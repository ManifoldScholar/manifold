\section{Description}\label{description}}

Pandoc is a \href{https://www.haskell.org}{Haskell} library for
converting from one markup format to another, and a command-line tool
that uses this library.

Pandoc can convert between numerous markup and word processing formats,
including, but not limited to, various flavors of
\href{http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}{Markdown},
\href{http://www.w3.org/html/}{HTML},
\href{http://latex-project.org}{LaTeX} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML}{Word docx}. For the
full lists of input and output formats, see the \texttt{-\/-from} and
\texttt{-\/-to} \protect\hyperlink{general-options}{options below}.
Pandoc can also produce \href{https://www.adobe.com/pdf/}{PDF} output:
see \protect\hyperlink{creating-a-pdf}{creating a PDF}, below.

Pandoc's enhanced version of Markdown includes syntax for
\protect\hyperlink{tables}{tables},
\protect\hyperlink{definition-lists}{definition lists},
\protect\hyperlink{metadata-blocks}{metadata blocks},
\protect\hyperlink{footnotes}{footnotes},
\protect\hyperlink{citations}{citations},
\protect\hyperlink{math}{math}, and much more. See below under
\protect\hyperlink{pandocs-markdown}{Pandoc's Markdown}.

Pandoc has a modular design: it consists of a set of readers, which
parse text in a given format and produce a native representation of the
document (an \emph{abstract syntax tree} or AST), and a set of writers,
which convert this native representation into a target format. Thus,
adding an input or output format requires only adding a reader or
writer. Users can also run custom
\href{http://pandoc.org/filters.html}{pandoc filters} to modify the
intermediate AST.

Because pandoc's intermediate representation of a document is less
expressive than many of the formats it converts between, one should not
expect perfect conversions between every format and every other. Pandoc
attempts to preserve the structural elements of a document, but not
formatting details such as margin size. And some document elements, such
as complex tables, may not fit into pandoc's simple document model.
While conversions from pandoc's Markdown to all formats aspire to be
perfect, conversions from formats more expressive than pandoc's Markdown
can be expected to be lossy.

\hypertarget{using-pandoc}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Using
\texttt{pandoc}}{Using pandoc}}\label{using-pandoc}}

If no \emph{input-files} are specified, input is read from \emph{stdin}.
Output goes to \emph{stdout} by default. For output to a file, use the
\texttt{-o} option:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -o output.html input.txt
\end{verbatim}

By default, pandoc produces a document fragment. To produce a standalone
document (e.g.~a valid HTML file including
\texttt{\textless{}head\textgreater{}} and
\texttt{\textless{}body\textgreater{}}), use the \texttt{-s} or
\texttt{-\/-standalone} flag:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -s -o output.html input.txt
\end{verbatim}

For more information on how standalone documents are produced, see
\protect\hyperlink{templates}{Templates} below.

If multiple input files are given, \texttt{pandoc} will concatenate them
all (with blank lines between them) before parsing. (Use
\texttt{-\/-file-scope} to parse files individually.)

\hypertarget{specifying-formats}{%
\subsection{Specifying formats}\label{specifying-formats}}

The format of the input and output can be specified explicitly using
command-line options. The input format can be specified using the
\texttt{-f/-\/-from} option, the output format using the
\texttt{-t/-\/-to} option. Thus, to convert \texttt{hello.txt} from
Markdown to LaTeX, you could type:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -f markdown -t latex hello.txt
\end{verbatim}

To convert \texttt{hello.html} from HTML to Markdown:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -f html -t markdown hello.html
\end{verbatim}

Supported input and output formats are listed below under
\protect\hyperlink{options}{Options} (see \texttt{-f} for input formats
and \texttt{-t} for output formats). You can also use
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-list-input-formats} and
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-list-output-formats} to print lists of supported
formats.

If the input or output format is not specified explicitly,
\texttt{pandoc} will attempt to guess it from the extensions of the
filenames. Thus, for example,

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -o hello.tex hello.txt
\end{verbatim}

will convert \texttt{hello.txt} from Markdown to LaTeX. If no output
file is specified (so that output goes to \emph{stdout}), or if the
output file's extension is unknown, the output format will default to
HTML. If no input file is specified (so that input comes from
\emph{stdin}), or if the input files' extensions are unknown, the input
format will be assumed to be Markdown.

\hypertarget{character-encoding}{%
\subsection{Character encoding}\label{character-encoding}}

Pandoc uses the UTF-8 character encoding for both input and output. If
your local character encoding is not UTF-8, you should pipe input and
output through
\href{http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/}{\texttt{iconv}}:

\begin{verbatim}
iconv -t utf-8 input.txt | pandoc | iconv -f utf-8
\end{verbatim}

Note that in some output formats (such as HTML, LaTeX, ConTeXt, RTF,
OPML, DocBook, and Texinfo), information about the character encoding is
included in the document header, which will only be included if you use
the \texttt{-s/-\/-standalone} option.

\hypertarget{creating-a-pdf}{%
\subsection{Creating a PDF}\label{creating-a-pdf}}

To produce a PDF, specify an output file with a \texttt{.pdf} extension:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc test.txt -o test.pdf
\end{verbatim}

By default, pandoc will use LaTeX to create the PDF, which requires that
a LaTeX engine be installed (see \texttt{-\/-pdf-engine} below).

Alternatively, pandoc can use
\href{http://www.contextgarden.net/}{ConTeXt}, \texttt{pdfroff}, or any
of the following HTML/CSS-to-PDF-engines, to create a PDF:
\href{https://wkhtmltopdf.org}{\texttt{wkhtmltopdf}},
\href{http://weasyprint.org}{\texttt{weasyprint}} or
\href{https://www.princexml.com/}{\texttt{prince}}. To do this, specify
an output file with a \texttt{.pdf} extension, as before, but add the
\texttt{-\/-pdf-engine} option or \texttt{-t\ context},
\texttt{-t\ html}, or \texttt{-t\ ms} to the command line
(\texttt{-t\ html} defaults to \texttt{-\/-pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf}).

PDF output can be controlled using
\protect\hyperlink{variables-for-latex}{variables for LaTeX} (if LaTeX
is used) and \protect\hyperlink{variables-for-context}{variables for
ConTeXt} (if ConTeXt is used). When using an HTML/CSS-to-PDF-engine,
\texttt{-\/-css} affects the output. If \texttt{wkhtmltopdf} is used,
then the variables \texttt{margin-left}, \texttt{margin-right},
\texttt{margin-top}, \texttt{margin-bottom}, \texttt{footer-html},
\texttt{header-html} and \texttt{papersize} will affect the output.

To debug the PDF creation, it can be useful to look at the intermediate
representation: instead of \texttt{-o\ test.pdf}, use for example
\texttt{-s\ -o\ test.tex} to output the generated LaTeX. You can then
test it with \texttt{pdflatex\ test.tex}.

When using LaTeX, the following packages need to be available (they are
included with all recent versions of
\href{http://www.tug.org/texlive/}{TeX Live}):
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/amsfonts}{\texttt{amsfonts}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath}{\texttt{amsmath}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/lm}{\texttt{lm}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math}{\texttt{unicode-math}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/ifxetex}{\texttt{ifxetex}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/ifluatex}{\texttt{ifluatex}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/listings}{\texttt{listings}} (if the
\texttt{-\/-listings} option is used),
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyvrb}{\texttt{fancyvrb}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/longtable}{\texttt{longtable}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}{\texttt{booktabs}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx}{\texttt{graphicx}} and
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/grffile}{\texttt{grffile}} (if the document
contains images),
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref}{\texttt{hyperref}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/xcolor}{\texttt{xcolor}} (with
\texttt{colorlinks}), \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/ulem}{\texttt{ulem}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry}{\texttt{geometry}} (with the
\texttt{geometry} variable set),
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/setspace}{\texttt{setspace}} (with
\texttt{linestretch}), and
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/babel}{\texttt{babel}} (with \texttt{lang}).
The use of \texttt{xelatex} or \texttt{lualatex} as the LaTeX engine
requires \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec}{\texttt{fontspec}}.
\texttt{xelatex} uses
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/polyglossia}{\texttt{polyglossia}} (with
\texttt{lang}), \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/xecjk}{\texttt{xecjk}}, and
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/bidi}{\texttt{bidi}} (with the \texttt{dir}
variable set). If the \texttt{mathspec} variable is set,
\texttt{xelatex} will use
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/mathspec}{\texttt{mathspec}} instead of
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math}{\texttt{unicode-math}}. The
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/upquote}{\texttt{upquote}} and
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/microtype}{\texttt{microtype}} packages are
used if available, and
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/csquotes}{\texttt{csquotes}} will be used for
\protect\hyperlink{typography}{typography} if added to the template or
included in any header file. The
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib}{\texttt{natbib}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex}{\texttt{biblatex}},
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex}{\texttt{bibtex}}, and
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/biber}{\texttt{biber}} packages can
optionally be used for \protect\hyperlink{citation-rendering}{citation
rendering}.

\hypertarget{reading-from-the-web}{%
\subsection{Reading from the Web}\label{reading-from-the-web}}

Instead of an input file, an absolute URI may be given. In this case
pandoc will fetch the content using HTTP:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -f html -t markdown http://www.fsf.org
\end{verbatim}

It is possible to supply a custom User-Agent string or other header when
requesting a document from a URL:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -f html -t markdown --request-header User-Agent:"Mozilla/5.0" \
  http://www.fsf.org
\end{verbatim}

\item[\texttt{-\/-data-dir=}\emph{DIRECTORY}]
Specify the user data directory to search for pandoc data files. If this
option is not specified, the default user data directory will be used.
This is, in UNIX:

\begin{verbatim}
$HOME/.pandoc
\end{verbatim}

in Windows XP:

\begin{verbatim}
C:\Documents And Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\pandoc
\end{verbatim}

and in Windows Vista or later:

\begin{verbatim}
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\pandoc
\end{verbatim}

You can find the default user data directory on your system by looking
at the output of \texttt{pandoc\ -\/-version}. A \texttt{reference.odt},
\texttt{reference.docx}, \texttt{epub.css}, \texttt{templates},
\texttt{slidy}, \texttt{slideous}, or \texttt{s5} directory placed in
this directory will override pandoc's normal defaults.
\item[\texttt{-\/-bash-completion}]
Generate a bash completion script. To enable bash completion with
pandoc, add this to your \texttt{.bashrc}:

\begin{verbatim}
eval "$(pandoc --bash-completion)"
\end{verbatim}
\item[\texttt{-\/-verbose}]
Give verbose debugging output. Currently this only has an effect with
PDF output.
\item[\texttt{-\/-quiet}]
Suppress warning messages.
\item[\texttt{-\/-fail-if-warnings}]
Exit with error status if there are any warnings.
\item[\texttt{-\/-log=}\emph{FILE}]
Write log messages in machine-readable JSON format to \emph{FILE}. All
messages above DEBUG level will be written, regardless of verbosity
settings (\texttt{-\/-verbose}, \texttt{-\/-quiet}).
\item[\texttt{-\/-list-input-formats}]
List supported input formats, one per line.
\item[\texttt{-\/-list-output-formats}]
List supported output formats, one per line.
\item[\texttt{-\/-list-extensions}{[}\texttt{=}\emph{FORMAT}{]}]
List supported extensions, one per line, preceded by a \texttt{+} or
\texttt{-} indicating whether it is enabled by default in \emph{FORMAT}.
If \emph{FORMAT} is not specified, defaults for pandoc's Markdown are
given.
\item[\texttt{-\/-list-highlight-languages}]
List supported languages for syntax highlighting, one per line.
\item[\texttt{-\/-list-highlight-styles}]
List supported styles for syntax highlighting, one per line. See
\texttt{-\/-highlight-style}.
\item[\texttt{-v}, \texttt{-\/-version}]

instead.} Ignore paragraphs with no content. This option is useful for
converting word processing documents where users have used empty
paragraphs to create inter-paragraph space.
\item[\texttt{-\/-indented-code-classes=}\emph{CLASSES}]
Specify classes to use for indented code blocks--for example,
\texttt{perl,numberLines} or \texttt{haskell}. Multiple classes may be
separated by spaces or commas.
\item[\texttt{-\/-default-image-extension=}\emph{EXTENSION}]
Specify a default extension to use when image paths/URLs have no
extension. This allows you to use the same source for formats that
require different kinds of images. Currently this option only affects
the Markdown and LaTeX readers.
\item[\texttt{-\/-file-scope}]
Parse each file individually before combining for multifile documents.
This will allow footnotes in different files with the same identifiers
to work as expected. If this option is set, footnotes and links will not
work across files. Reading binary files (docx, odt, epub) implies
\texttt{-\/-file-scope}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-filter=}\emph{PROGRAM}]
Specify an executable to be used as a filter transforming the pandoc AST
after the input is parsed and before the output is written. The
executable should read JSON from stdin and write JSON to stdout. The
JSON must be formatted like pandoc's own JSON input and output. The name
of the output format will be passed to the filter as the first argument.
Hence,

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc --filter ./caps.py -t latex
\end{verbatim}

is equivalent to

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -t json | ./caps.py latex | pandoc -f json -t latex
\end{verbatim}

The latter form may be useful for debugging filters.

Filters may be written in any language. \texttt{Text.Pandoc.JSON}
exports \texttt{toJSONFilter} to facilitate writing filters in Haskell.
Those who would prefer to write filters in python can use the module
\href{https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters}{\texttt{pandocfilters}},
installable from PyPI. There are also pandoc filter libraries in
\href{https://github.com/vinai/pandocfilters-php}{PHP},
\href{https://metacpan.org/pod/Pandoc::Filter}{perl}, and
\href{https://github.com/mvhenderson/pandoc-filter-node}{JavaScript/node.js}.

In order of preference, pandoc will look for filters in

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  a specified full or relative path (executable or non-executable)
\item
  \texttt{\$DATADIR/filters} (executable or non-executable) where
  \texttt{\$DATADIR} is the user data directory (see
  \texttt{-\/-data-dir}, above).
\item
  \texttt{\$PATH} (executable only)
\end{enumerate}

Filters and lua-filters are applied in the order specified on the
command line.
\item[\texttt{-\/-lua-filter=}\emph{SCRIPT}]
Transform the document in a similar fashion as JSON filters (see
\texttt{-\/-filter}), but use pandoc's build-in lua filtering system.
The given lua script is expected to return a list of lua filters which
will be applied in order. Each lua filter must contain
element-transforming functions indexed by the name of the AST element on
which the filter function should be applied.

The \texttt{pandoc} lua module provides helper functions for element
creation. It is always loaded into the script's lua environment.

The following is an example lua script for macro-expansion:

\begin{verbatim}
function expand_hello_world(inline)
  if inline.c == '{{helloworld}}' then
    return pandoc.Emph{ pandoc.Str "Hello, World" }
  else
    return inline
  end
end

return {{Str = expand_hello_world}}
\end{verbatim}

In order of preference, pandoc will look for lua filters in

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  a specified full or relative path (executable or non-executable)
\item
  \texttt{\$DATADIR/filters} (executable or non-executable) where
  \texttt{\$DATADIR} is the user data directory (see
  \texttt{-\/-data-dir}, above).
\end{enumerate}
\item[\texttt{-M} \emph{KEY}{[}\texttt{=}\emph{VAL}{]},
\texttt{-\/-metadata=}\emph{KEY}{[}\texttt{:}\emph{VAL}{]}]
Set the metadata field \emph{KEY} to the value \emph{VAL}. A value
specified on the command line overrides a value specified in the
document using \protect\hyperlink{extension-yaml_metadata_block}{YAML
metadata blocks}. Values will be parsed as YAML boolean or string
values. If no value is specified, the value will be treated as Boolean
true. Like \texttt{-\/-variable}, \texttt{-\/-metadata} causes template
variables to be set. But unlike \texttt{-\/-variable},
\texttt{-\/-metadata} affects the metadata of the underlying document
(which is accessible from filters and may be printed in some output
formats) and metadata values will be escaped when inserted into the
template.
\item[\texttt{-p}, \texttt{-\/-preserve-tabs}]
Preserve tabs instead of converting them to spaces (the default). Note
that this will only affect tabs in literal code spans and code blocks;
tabs in regular text will be treated as spaces.
\item[\texttt{-\/-tab-stop=}\emph{NUMBER}]
Specify the number of spaces per tab (default is 4).
\item[\texttt{-\/-track-changes=accept}\textbar{}\texttt{reject}\textbar{}\texttt{all}]
Specifies what to do with insertions, deletions, and comments produced
by the MS Word ``Track Changes'' feature. \texttt{accept} (the default),
inserts all insertions, and ignores all deletions. \texttt{reject}
inserts all deletions and ignores insertions. Both \texttt{accept} and
\texttt{reject} ignore comments. \texttt{all} puts in insertions,
deletions, and comments, wrapped in spans with \texttt{insertion},
\texttt{deletion}, \texttt{comment-start}, and \texttt{comment-end}
classes, respectively. The author and time of change is included.
\texttt{all} is useful for scripting: only accepting changes from a
certain reviewer, say, or before a certain date. If a paragraph is
inserted or deleted, \texttt{track-changes=all} produces a span with the
class \texttt{paragraph-insertion}/\texttt{paragraph-deletion} before
the affected paragraph break. This option only affects the docx reader.
\item[\texttt{-\/-extract-media=}\emph{DIR}]
Extract images and other media contained in or linked from the source
document to the path \emph{DIR}, creating it if necessary, and adjust
the images references in the document so they point to the extracted
files. If the source format is a binary container (docx, epub, or odt),
the media is extracted from the container and the original filenames are
used. Otherwise the media is read from the file system or downloaded,
and new filenames are constructed based on SHA1 hashes of the contents.
\item[\texttt{-\/-abbreviations=}\emph{FILE}]
Specifies a custom abbreviations file, with abbreviations one to a line.
If this option is not specified, pandoc will read the data file
\texttt{abbreviations} from the user data directory or fall back on a
system default. To see the system default, use
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-print-default-data-file=abbreviations}. The only use
pandoc makes of this list is in the Markdown reader. Strings ending in a
period that are found in this list will be followed by a nonbreaking
space, so that the period will not produce sentence-ending space in
formats like LaTeX.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{general-writer-options}{%
\subsection{General writer options}\label{general-writer-options}}

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-s}, \texttt{-\/-standalone}]
Produce output with an appropriate header and footer (e.g.~a standalone
HTML, LaTeX, TEI, or RTF file, not a fragment). This option is set
automatically for \texttt{pdf}, \texttt{epub}, \texttt{epub3},
\texttt{fb2}, \texttt{docx}, and \texttt{odt} output. For
\texttt{native} output, this option causes metadata to be included;
otherwise, metadata is suppressed.
\item[\texttt{-\/-template=}\emph{FILE}]
Use \emph{FILE} as a custom template for the generated document. Implies
\texttt{-\/-standalone}. See \protect\hyperlink{templates}{Templates},
below, for a description of template syntax. If no extension is
specified, an extension corresponding to the writer will be added, so
that \texttt{-\/-template=special} looks for \texttt{special.html} for
HTML output. If the template is not found, pandoc will search for it in
the \texttt{templates} subdirectory of the user data directory (see
\texttt{-\/-data-dir}). If this option is not used, a default template
appropriate for the output format will be used (see
\texttt{-D/-\/-print-default-template}).
\item[\texttt{-V} \emph{KEY}{[}\texttt{=}\emph{VAL}{]},
\texttt{-\/-variable=}\emph{KEY}{[}\texttt{:}\emph{VAL}{]}]
Set the template variable \emph{KEY} to the value \emph{VAL} when
rendering the document in standalone mode. This is generally only useful
when the \texttt{-\/-template} option is used to specify a custom
template, since pandoc automatically sets the variables used in the
default templates. If no \emph{VAL} is specified, the key will be given
the value \texttt{true}.
\item[\texttt{-D} \emph{FORMAT},
\texttt{-\/-print-default-template=}\emph{FORMAT}]
Print the system default template for an output \emph{FORMAT}. (See
\texttt{-t} for a list of possible \emph{FORMAT}s.) Templates in the
user data directory are ignored.
\item[\texttt{-\/-print-default-data-file=}\emph{FILE}]
Print a system default data file. Files in the user data directory are
ignored.
\item[\texttt{-\/-eol=crlf}\textbar{}\texttt{lf}\textbar{}\texttt{native}]
Manually specify line endings: \texttt{crlf} (Windows), \texttt{lf}
(macOS/Linux/UNIX), or \texttt{native} (line endings appropriate to the
OS on which pandoc is being run). The default is \texttt{native}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-dpi}=\emph{NUMBER}]
Specify the dpi (dots per inch) value for conversion from pixels to
inch/centimeters and vice versa. The default is 96dpi. Technically, the
correct term would be ppi (pixels per inch).
\item[\texttt{-\/-wrap=auto}\textbar{}\texttt{none}\textbar{}\texttt{preserve}]
Determine how text is wrapped in the output (the source code, not the
rendered version). With \texttt{auto} (the default), pandoc will attempt
to wrap lines to the column width specified by \texttt{-\/-columns}
(default 72). With \texttt{none}, pandoc will not wrap lines at all.
With \texttt{preserve}, pandoc will attempt to preserve the wrapping
from the source document (that is, where there are nonsemantic newlines
in the source, there will be nonsemantic newlines in the output as
well). Automatic wrapping does not currently work in HTML output.
\item[\texttt{-\/-columns=}\emph{NUMBER}]
Specify length of lines in characters. This affects text wrapping in the
generated source code (see \texttt{-\/-wrap}). It also affects
calculation of column widths for plain text tables (see
\protect\hyperlink{tables}{Tables} below).
\item[\texttt{-\/-toc}, \texttt{-\/-table-of-contents}]
Include an automatically generated table of contents (or, in the case of
\texttt{latex}, \texttt{context}, \texttt{docx}, \texttt{odt},
\texttt{opendocument}, \texttt{rst}, or \texttt{ms}, an instruction to
create one) in the output document. This option has no effect on
\texttt{man}, \texttt{docbook4}, \texttt{docbook5}, or \texttt{jats}
output.
\item[\texttt{-\/-toc-depth=}\emph{NUMBER}]
Specify the number of section levels to include in the table of
contents. The default is 3 (which means that level 1, 2, and 3 headers
will be listed in the contents).
\item[\texttt{-\/-strip-comments}]
Strip out HTML comments in the Markdown or Textile source, rather than
passing them on to Markdown, Textile or HTML output as raw HTML. This
does not apply to HTML comments inside raw HTML blocks when the
\texttt{markdown\_in\_html\_blocks} extension is not set.
\item[\texttt{-\/-no-highlight}]
Disables syntax highlighting for code blocks and inlines, even when a
language attribute is given.
\item[\texttt{-\/-highlight-style=}\emph{STYLE}\textbar{}\emph{FILE}]
Specifies the coloring style to be used in highlighted source code.
Options are \texttt{pygments} (the default), \texttt{kate},
\texttt{monochrome}, \texttt{breezeDark}, \texttt{espresso},
\texttt{zenburn}, \texttt{haddock}, and \texttt{tango}. For more
information on syntax highlighting in pandoc, see
\protect\hyperlink{syntax-highlighting}{Syntax highlighting}, below. See
also \texttt{-\/-list-highlight-styles}.

Instead of a \emph{STYLE} name, a JSON file with extension
\texttt{.theme} may be supplied. This will be parsed as a KDE syntax
highlighting theme and (if valid) used as the highlighting style.

To generate the JSON version of an existing style, use
\texttt{-\/-print-highlight-style}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-print-highlight-style=}\emph{STYLE}\textbar{}\emph{FILE}]
Prints a JSON version of a highlighting style, which can be modified,
saved with a \texttt{.theme} extension, and used with
\texttt{-\/-highlight-style}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-syntax-definition=}\emph{FILE}]
Instructs pandoc to load a KDE XML syntax definition file, which will be
used for syntax highlighting of appropriately marked code blocks. This
can be used to add support for new languages or to use altered syntax
definitions for existing languages.
\item[\texttt{-H} \emph{FILE},
\texttt{-\/-include-in-header=}\emph{FILE}]
Include contents of \emph{FILE}, verbatim, at the end of the header.
This can be used, for example, to include special CSS or JavaScript in
HTML documents. This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple
files in the header. They will be included in the order specified.
Implies \texttt{-\/-standalone}.
\item[\texttt{-B} \emph{FILE},
\texttt{-\/-include-before-body=}\emph{FILE}]
Include contents of \emph{FILE}, verbatim, at the beginning of the
document body (e.g.~after the \texttt{\textless{}body\textgreater{}} tag
in HTML, or the \texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{document\}} command in
LaTeX). This can be used to include navigation bars or banners in HTML
documents. This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple files.
They will be included in the order specified. Implies
\texttt{-\/-standalone}.
\item[\texttt{-A} \emph{FILE},
\texttt{-\/-include-after-body=}\emph{FILE}]
Include contents of \emph{FILE}, verbatim, at the end of the document
body (before the \texttt{\textless{}/body\textgreater{}} tag in HTML, or
the \texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{document\}} command in LaTeX). This
option can be used repeatedly to include multiple files. They will be
included in the order specified. Implies \texttt{-\/-standalone}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-resource-path=}\emph{SEARCHPATH}]
List of paths to search for images and other resources. The paths should
be separated by \texttt{:} on Linux, UNIX, and macOS systems, and by
\texttt{;} on Windows. If \texttt{-\/-resource-path} is not specified,
the default resource path is the working directory. Note that, if
\texttt{-\/-resource-path} is specified, the working directory must be
explicitly listed or it will not be searched. For example:
\texttt{-\/-resource-path=.:test} will search the working directory and
the \texttt{test} subdirectory, in that order.
\item[\texttt{-\/-request-header=}\emph{NAME}\texttt{:}\emph{VAL}]
Set the request header \emph{NAME} to the value \emph{VAL} when making
HTTP requests (for example, when a URL is given on the command line, or
when resources used in a document must be downloaded).
\end{description}

\hypertarget{options-affecting-specific-writers}{%
\subsection{Options affecting specific
writers}\label{options-affecting-specific-writers}}

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-\/-self-contained}]
Produce a standalone HTML file with no external dependencies, using
\texttt{data:} URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts,
stylesheets, images, and videos. Implies \texttt{-\/-standalone}. The
resulting file should be ``self-contained,'' in the sense that it needs
no external files and no net access to be displayed properly by a
browser. This option works only with HTML output formats, including
\texttt{html4}, \texttt{html5}, \texttt{html+lhs}, \texttt{html5+lhs},
\texttt{s5}, \texttt{slidy}, \texttt{slideous}, \texttt{dzslides}, and
\texttt{revealjs}. Scripts, images, and stylesheets at absolute URLs
will be downloaded; those at relative URLs will be sought relative to
the working directory (if the first source file is local) or relative to
the base URL (if the first source file is remote). Elements with the
attribute \texttt{data-external="1"} will be left alone; the documents
they link to will not be incorporated in the document. Limitation:
resources that are loaded dynamically through JavaScript cannot be
incorporated; as a result, \texttt{-\/-self-contained} does not work
with \texttt{-\/-mathjax}, and some advanced features (e.g.~zoom or
speaker notes) may not work in an offline ``self-contained''
\texttt{reveal.js} slide show.
\item[\texttt{-\/-html-q-tags}]
Use \texttt{\textless{}q\textgreater{}} tags for quotes in HTML.
\item[\texttt{-\/-ascii}]
Use only ASCII characters in output. Currently supported for XML and
HTML formats (which use numerical entities instead of UTF-8 when this
option is selected) and for groff ms and man (which use hexadecimal
escapes).
\item[\texttt{-\/-reference-links}]
Use reference-style links, rather than inline links, in writing Markdown
or reStructuredText. By default inline links are used. The placement of
link references is affected by the \texttt{-\/-reference-location}
option.
\item[\texttt{-\/-reference-location\ =\ block}\textbar{}\texttt{section}\textbar{}\texttt{document}]
Specify whether footnotes (and references, if \texttt{reference-links}
is set) are placed at the end of the current (top-level) block, the
current section, or the document. The default is \texttt{document}.
Currently only affects the markdown writer.
\item[\texttt{-\/-atx-headers}]
Use ATX-style headers in Markdown and AsciiDoc output. The default is to
use setext-style headers for levels 1-2, and then ATX headers. (Note:
for \texttt{gfm} output, ATX headers are always used.)
\item[\texttt{-\/-top-level-division={[}default\textbar{}section\textbar{}chapter\textbar{}part{]}}]
Treat top-level headers as the given division type in LaTeX, ConTeXt,
DocBook, and TEI output. The hierarchy order is part, chapter, then
section; all headers are shifted such that the top-level header becomes
the specified type. The default behavior is to determine the best
division type via heuristics: unless other conditions apply,
\texttt{section} is chosen. When the LaTeX document class is set to
\texttt{report}, \texttt{book}, or \texttt{memoir} (unless the
\texttt{article} option is specified), \texttt{chapter} is implied as
the setting for this option. If \texttt{beamer} is the output format,
specifying either \texttt{chapter} or \texttt{part} will cause top-level
headers to become \texttt{\textbackslash{}part\{..\}}, while
second-level headers remain as their default type.
\item[\texttt{-N}, \texttt{-\/-number-sections}]
Number section headings in LaTeX, ConTeXt, HTML, or EPUB output. By
default, sections are not numbered. Sections with class
\texttt{unnumbered} will never be numbered, even if
\texttt{-\/-number-sections} is specified.
\item[\texttt{-\/-number-offset=}\emph{NUMBER}{[}\texttt{,}\emph{NUMBER}\texttt{,}\emph{\ldots{}}{]}]
Offset for section headings in HTML output (ignored in other output
formats). The first number is added to the section number for top-level
headers, the second for second-level headers, and so on. So, for
example, if you want the first top-level header in your document to be
numbered ``6'', specify \texttt{-\/-number-offset=5}. If your document
starts with a level-2 header which you want to be numbered ``1.5'',
specify \texttt{-\/-number-offset=1,4}. Offsets are 0 by default.
Implies \texttt{-\/-number-sections}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-listings}]
Use the \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/listings}{\texttt{listings}} package
for LaTeX code blocks
\item[\texttt{-i}, \texttt{-\/-incremental}]
Make list items in slide shows display incrementally (one by one). The
default is for lists to be displayed all at once.
\item[\texttt{-\/-slide-level=}\emph{NUMBER}]
Specifies that headers with the specified level create slides (for
\texttt{beamer}, \texttt{s5}, \texttt{slidy}, \texttt{slideous},
\texttt{dzslides}). Headers above this level in the hierarchy are used
to divide the slide show into sections; headers below this level create
subheads within a slide. Note that content that is not contained under
slide-level headers will not appear in the slide show. The default is to
set the slide level based on the contents of the document; see
\protect\hyperlink{structuring-the-slide-show}{Structuring the slide
show}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-section-divs}]
Wrap sections in \texttt{\textless{}section\textgreater{}} tags (or
\texttt{\textless{}div\textgreater{}} tags for \texttt{html4}), and
attach identifiers to the enclosing
\texttt{\textless{}section\textgreater{}} (or
\texttt{\textless{}div\textgreater{}}) rather than the header itself.
See \protect\hyperlink{header-identifiers}{Header identifiers}, below.
\item[\texttt{-\/-email-obfuscation=none}\textbar{}\texttt{javascript}\textbar{}\texttt{references}]
Specify a method for obfuscating \texttt{mailto:} links in HTML
documents. \texttt{none} leaves \texttt{mailto:} links as they are.
\texttt{javascript} obfuscates them using JavaScript.
\texttt{references} obfuscates them by printing their letters as decimal
or hexadecimal character references. The default is \texttt{none}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-id-prefix=}\emph{STRING}]
Specify a prefix to be added to all identifiers and internal links in
HTML and DocBook output, and to footnote numbers in Markdown and Haddock
output. This is useful for preventing duplicate identifiers when
generating fragments to be included in other pages.
\item[\texttt{-T} \emph{STRING},
\texttt{-\/-title-prefix=}\emph{STRING}]
Specify \emph{STRING} as a prefix at the beginning of the title that
appears in the HTML header (but not in the title as it appears at the
beginning of the HTML body). Implies \texttt{-\/-standalone}.
\item[\texttt{-c} \emph{URL}, \texttt{-\/-css=}\emph{URL}]
Link to a CSS style sheet. This option can be used repeatedly to include
multiple files. They will be included in the order specified.

A stylesheet is required for generating EPUB. If none is provided using
this option (or the \texttt{stylesheet} metadata field), pandoc will
look for a file \texttt{epub.css} in the user data directory (see
\texttt{-\/-data-dir}). If it is not found there, sensible defaults will
be used.
\item[\texttt{-\/-reference-doc=}\emph{FILE}]
Use the specified file as a style reference in producing a docx or ODT
file.

\begin{description}
\item[Docx]
For best results, the reference docx should be a modified version of a
docx file produced using pandoc. The contents of the reference docx are
ignored, but its stylesheets and document properties (including margins,
page size, header, and footer) are used in the new docx. If no reference
docx is specified on the command line, pandoc will look for a file
\texttt{reference.docx} in the user data directory (see
\texttt{-\/-data-dir}). If this is not found either, sensible defaults
will be used.

To produce a custom \texttt{reference.docx}, first get a copy of the
default \texttt{reference.docx}:
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-print-default-data-file\ reference.docx\ \textgreater{}\ custom-reference.docx}.
Then open \texttt{custom-reference.docx} in Word, modify the styles as
you wish, and save the file. For best results, do not make changes to
this file other than modifying the styles used by pandoc:
{[}paragraph{]} Normal, Body Text, First Paragraph, Compact, Title,
Subtitle, Author, Date, Abstract, Bibliography, Heading 1, Heading 2,
Heading 3, Heading 4, Heading 5, Heading 6, Heading 7, Heading 8,
Heading 9, Block Text, Footnote Text, Definition Term, Definition,
Caption, Table Caption, Image Caption, Figure, Captioned Figure, TOC
Heading; {[}character{]} Default Paragraph Font, Body Text Char,
Verbatim Char, Footnote Reference, Hyperlink; {[}table{]} Table.
\item[ODT]
For best results, the reference ODT should be a modified version of an
ODT produced using pandoc. The contents of the reference ODT are
ignored, but its stylesheets are used in the new ODT. If no reference
ODT is specified on the command line, pandoc will look for a file
\texttt{reference.odt} in the user data directory (see
\texttt{-\/-data-dir}). If this is not found either, sensible defaults
will be used.

To produce a custom \texttt{reference.odt}, first get a copy of the
default \texttt{reference.odt}:
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-print-default-data-file\ reference.odt\ \textgreater{}\ custom-reference.odt}.
Then open \texttt{custom-reference.odt} in LibreOffice, modify the
styles as you wish, and save the file.
\item[PowerPoint]
Any template included with a recent install of Microsoft PowerPoint
(either with \texttt{.pptx} or \texttt{.potx} extension) should work, as
will most templates derived from these.

The specific requirement is that the template should contain the
following four layouts as its first four layouts:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Title Slide
\item
  Title and Content
\item
  Section Header
\item
  Two Content
\end{enumerate}

All templates included with a recent version of MS PowerPoint will fit
these criteria. (You can click on \texttt{Layout} under the
\texttt{Home} menu to check.)

You can also modify the default \texttt{reference.pptx}: first run
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-print-default-data-file\ reference.pptx\ \textgreater{}\ custom-reference.pptx},
and then modify \texttt{custom-reference.pptx} in MS PowerPoint (pandoc
will use the first four layout slides, as mentioned above).
\end{description}
\item[\texttt{-\/-epub-cover-image=}\emph{FILE}]
Use the specified image as the EPUB cover. It is recommended that the
image be less than 1000px in width and height. Note that in a Markdown
source document you can also specify \texttt{cover-image} in a YAML
metadata block (see \protect\hyperlink{epub-metadata}{EPUB Metadata},
below).
\item[\texttt{-\/-epub-metadata=}\emph{FILE}]
Look in the specified XML file for metadata for the EPUB. The file
should contain a series of
\href{http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/}{Dublin Core elements}. For
example:

\begin{verbatim}
 <dc:rights>Creative Commons</dc:rights>
 <dc:language>es-AR</dc:language>
\end{verbatim}

By default, pandoc will include the following metadata elements:
\texttt{\textless{}dc:title\textgreater{}} (from the document title),
\texttt{\textless{}dc:creator\textgreater{}} (from the document
authors), \texttt{\textless{}dc:date\textgreater{}} (from the document
date, which should be in \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime}{ISO
8601 format}), \texttt{\textless{}dc:language\textgreater{}} (from the
\texttt{lang} variable, or, if is not set, the locale), and
\texttt{\textless{}dc:identifier\ id="BookId"\textgreater{}} (a randomly
generated UUID). Any of these may be overridden by elements in the
metadata file.

Note: if the source document is Markdown, a YAML metadata block in the
document can be used instead. See below under
\protect\hyperlink{epub-metadata}{EPUB Metadata}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-epub-embed-font=}\emph{FILE}]
Embed the specified font in the EPUB. This option can be repeated to
embed multiple fonts. Wildcards can also be used: for example,
\texttt{DejaVuSans-*.ttf}. However, if you use wildcards on the command
line, be sure to escape them or put the whole filename in single quotes,
to prevent them from being interpreted by the shell. To use the embedded
fonts, you will need to add declarations like the following to your CSS
(see \texttt{-\/-css}):

\begin{verbatim}
@font-face {
font-family: DejaVuSans;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: normal;
src:url("DejaVuSans-Regular.ttf");
}
@font-face {
font-family: DejaVuSans;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: bold;
src:url("DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf");
}
@font-face {
font-family: DejaVuSans;
font-style: italic;
font-weight: normal;
src:url("DejaVuSans-Oblique.ttf");
}
@font-face {
font-family: DejaVuSans;
font-style: italic;
font-weight: bold;
src:url("DejaVuSans-BoldOblique.ttf");
}
body { font-family: "DejaVuSans"; }
\end{verbatim}
\item[\texttt{-\/-epub-chapter-level=}\emph{NUMBER}]
Specify the header level at which to split the EPUB into separate
``chapter'' files. The default is to split into chapters at level 1
headers. This option only affects the internal composition of the EPUB,
not the way chapters and sections are displayed to users. Some readers
may be slow if the chapter files are too large, so for large documents
with few level 1 headers, one might want to use a chapter level of 2 or
3.
\item[\texttt{-\/-epub-subdirectory=}\emph{DIRNAME}]
Specify the subdirectory in the OCF container that is to hold the
EPUB-specific contents. The default is \texttt{EPUB}. To put the EPUB
contents in the top level, use an empty string.
\item[\texttt{-\/-pdf-engine=pdflatex}\textbar{}\texttt{lualatex}\textbar{}\texttt{xelatex}\textbar{}\texttt{wkhtmltopdf}\textbar{}\texttt{weasyprint}\textbar{}\texttt{prince}\textbar{}\texttt{context}\textbar{}\texttt{pdfroff}]

\hypertarget{citation-rendering}{%
\subsection{Citation rendering}\label{citation-rendering}}

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-\/-bibliography=}\emph{FILE}]
Set the \texttt{bibliography} field in the document's metadata to
\emph{FILE}, overriding any value set in the metadata, and process
citations using \texttt{pandoc-citeproc}. (This is equivalent to
\texttt{-\/-metadata\ bibliography=FILE\ -\/-filter\ pandoc-citeproc}.)
If \texttt{-\/-natbib} or \texttt{-\/-biblatex} is also supplied,
\texttt{pandoc-citeproc} is not used, making this equivalent to
\texttt{-\/-metadata\ bibliography=FILE}. If you supply this argument
multiple times, each \emph{FILE} will be added to bibliography.
\item[\texttt{-\/-csl=}\emph{FILE}]
Set the \texttt{csl} field in the document's metadata to \emph{FILE},
overriding any value set in the metadata. (This is equivalent to
\texttt{-\/-metadata\ csl=FILE}.) This option is only relevant with
\texttt{pandoc-citeproc}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-citation-abbreviations=}\emph{FILE}]
Set the \texttt{citation-abbreviations} field in the document's metadata
to \emph{FILE}, overriding any value set in the metadata. (This is
equivalent to \texttt{-\/-metadata\ citation-abbreviations=FILE}.) This
option is only relevant with \texttt{pandoc-citeproc}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-natbib}]
Use \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib}{\texttt{natbib}} for citations in
LaTeX output. This option is not for use with the
\texttt{pandoc-citeproc} filter or with PDF output. It is intended for
use in producing a LaTeX file that can be processed with
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex}{\texttt{bibtex}}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-biblatex}]
Use \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex}{\texttt{biblatex}} for
citations in LaTeX output. This option is not for use with the
\texttt{pandoc-citeproc} filter or with PDF output. It is intended for
use in producing a LaTeX file that can be processed with
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtex}{\texttt{bibtex}} or
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/biber}{\texttt{biber}}.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{math-rendering-in-html}{%
\subsection{Math rendering in HTML}\label{math-rendering-in-html}}

The default is to render TeX math as far as possible using Unicode
characters. Formulas are put inside a \texttt{span} with
\texttt{class="math"}, so that they may be styled differently from the
surrounding text if needed. However, this gives acceptable results only
for basic math, usually you will want to use \texttt{-\/-mathjax} or
another of the following options.

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-\/-mathjax}{[}\texttt{=}\emph{URL}{]}]
Use \href{https://www.mathjax.org}{MathJax} to display embedded TeX math
in HTML output. TeX math will be put between
\texttt{\textbackslash{}(...\textbackslash{})} (for inline math) or
\texttt{\textbackslash{}{[}...\textbackslash{}{]}} (for display math)
and wrapped in \texttt{\textless{}span\textgreater{}} tags with class
\texttt{math}. Then the MathJax JavaScript will render it. The
\emph{URL} should point to the \texttt{MathJax.js} load script. If a
\emph{URL} is not provided, a link to the Cloudflare CDN will be
inserted.
\item[\texttt{-\/-mathml}]
Convert TeX math to \href{http://www.w3.org/Math/}{MathML} (in
\texttt{epub3}, \texttt{docbook4}, \texttt{docbook5}, \texttt{jats},
\texttt{html4} and \texttt{html5}). This is the default in \texttt{odt}
output. Note that currently only Firefox and Safari (and select e-book
readers) natively support MathML.
\item[\texttt{-\/-webtex}{[}\texttt{=}\emph{URL}{]}]
Convert TeX formulas to \texttt{\textless{}img\textgreater{}} tags that
link to an external script that converts formulas to images. The formula
will be URL-encoded and concatenated with the URL provided. For SVG
images you can for example use
\texttt{-\/-webtex\ https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?}. If no URL is
specified, the CodeCogs URL generating PNGs will be used
(\texttt{https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?}). Note: the
\texttt{-\/-webtex} option will affect Markdown output as well as HTML,
which is useful if you're targeting a version of Markdown without native
math support.
\item[\texttt{-\/-katex}{[}\texttt{=}\emph{URL}{]}]
Use \href{https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX}{KaTeX} to display embedded TeX
math in HTML output. The \emph{URL} is the base URL for the KaTeX
library. If a \emph{URL} is not provided, a link to the KaTeX CDN will
be inserted.
\item[\texttt{-\/-katex-stylesheet=}\emph{URL}]
The \emph{URL} should point to the \texttt{katex.css} stylesheet. If
this option is not specified, a link to the KaTeX CDN will be inserted.
Note that this option does not imply \texttt{-\/-katex}.
\item[\texttt{-\/-gladtex}]
Enclose TeX math in \texttt{\textless{}eq\textgreater{}} tags in HTML
output. The resulting HTML can then be processed by
\href{http://humenda.github.io/GladTeX/}{GladTeX} to produce images of
the typeset formulas and an HTML file with links to these images. So,
the procedure is:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -s --gladtex input.md -o myfile.htex
gladtex -d myfile-images myfile.htex
# produces myfile.html and images in myfile-images
\end{verbatim}
\end{description}

\hypertarget{options-for-wrapper-scripts}{%
\subsection{Options for wrapper
scripts}\label{options-for-wrapper-scripts}}

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{-\/-dump-args}]
Print information about command-line arguments to \emph{stdout}, then
exit. This option is intended primarily for use in wrapper scripts. The
first line of output contains the name of the output file specified with
the \texttt{-o} option, or \texttt{-} (for \emph{stdout}) if no output
file was specified. The remaining lines contain the command-line
arguments, one per line, in the order they appear. These do not include
regular pandoc options and their arguments, but do include any options
appearing after a \texttt{-\/-} separator at the end of the line.
\item[\texttt{-\/-ignore-args}]
Ignore command-line arguments (for use in wrapper scripts). Regular
pandoc options are not ignored. Thus, for example,

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc --ignore-args -o foo.html -s foo.txt -- -e latin1
\end{verbatim}

is equivalent to

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -o foo.html -s
\end{verbatim}
\end{description}

\hypertarget{templates}{%
\section{Templates}\label{templates}}

When the \texttt{-s/-\/-standalone} option is used, pandoc uses a
template to add header and footer material that is needed for a
self-standing document. To see the default template that is used, just
type

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -D *FORMAT*
\end{verbatim}

where \emph{FORMAT} is the name of the output format. A custom template
can be specified using the \texttt{-\/-template} option. You can also
override the system default templates for a given output format
\emph{FORMAT} by putting a file \texttt{templates/default.*FORMAT*} in
the user data directory (see \texttt{-\/-data-dir}, above).
\emph{Exceptions:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For \texttt{odt} output, customize the \texttt{default.opendocument}
  template.
\item
  For \texttt{pdf} output, customize the \texttt{default.latex} template
  (or the \texttt{default.context} template, if you use
  \texttt{-t\ context}, or the \texttt{default.ms} template, if you use
  \texttt{-t\ ms}, or the \texttt{default.html} template, if you use
  \texttt{-t\ html}).
\item
  \texttt{docx} has no template (however, you can use
  \texttt{-\/-reference-doc} to customize the output).
\end{itemize}

Templates contain \emph{variables}, which allow for the inclusion of
arbitrary information at any point in the file. They may be set at the
command line using the \texttt{-V/-\/-variable} option. If a variable is
not set, pandoc will look for the key in the document's metadata --
which can be set using either
\protect\hyperlink{extension-yaml_metadata_block}{YAML metadata blocks}
or with the \texttt{-\/-metadata} option.

\hypertarget{variables-set-by-pandoc}{%
\subsection{Variables set by pandoc}\label{variables-set-by-pandoc}}

Some variables are set automatically by pandoc. These vary somewhat
depending on the output format, but include the following:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{sourcefile}, \texttt{outputfile}]
source and destination filenames, as given on the command line.
\texttt{sourcefile} can also be a list if input comes from multiple
files, or empty if input is from stdin. You can use the following
snippet in your template to distinguish them:

\begin{verbatim}
$if(sourcefile)$
$for(sourcefile)$
$sourcefile$
$endfor$
$else$
(stdin)
$endif$
\end{verbatim}

Similarly, \texttt{outputfile} can be \texttt{-} if output goes to the
terminal.
\item[\texttt{title}, \texttt{author}, \texttt{date}]
allow identification of basic aspects of the document. Included in PDF
metadata through LaTeX and ConTeXt. These can be set through a
\protect\hyperlink{extension-pandoc_title_block}{pandoc title block},
which allows for multiple authors, or through a YAML metadata block:

\begin{verbatim}
---
author:
- Aristotle
- Peter Abelard
...
\end{verbatim}
\item[\texttt{subtitle}]
document subtitle, included in HTML, EPUB, LaTeX, ConTeXt, and Word
docx; renders in LaTeX only when using a document class that supports
\texttt{\textbackslash{}subtitle}, such as \texttt{beamer} or the
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script}{KOMA-Script} series
(\texttt{scrartcl}, \texttt{scrreprt}, \texttt{scrbook}).\footnote{To
  make \texttt{subtitle} work with other LaTeX document classes, you can
  add the following to \texttt{header-includes}:

\begin{Verbatim}
\providecommand{\subtitle}[1]{%
  \usepackage{titling}
  \posttitle{%
    \par\large#1\end{center}}
}
\end{Verbatim}
}
\item[\texttt{institute}]
author affiliations (in LaTeX and Beamer only). Can be a list, when
there are multiple authors.
\item[\texttt{abstract}]
document summary, included in LaTeX, ConTeXt, AsciiDoc, and Word docx
\item[\texttt{keywords}]
list of keywords to be included in HTML, PDF, and AsciiDoc metadata; may
be repeated as for \texttt{author}, above
\item[\texttt{header-includes}]
contents specified by \texttt{-H/-\/-include-in-header} (may have
multiple values)
\item[\texttt{toc}]
non-null value if \texttt{-\/-toc/-\/-table-of-contents} was specified
\item[\texttt{toc-title}]
title of table of contents (works only with EPUB, opendocument, odt,
docx, pptx)
\item[\texttt{include-before}]
contents specified by \texttt{-B/-\/-include-before-body} (may have
multiple values)
\item[\texttt{include-after}]
contents specified by \texttt{-A/-\/-include-after-body} (may have
multiple values)
\item[\texttt{body}]
body of document
\item[\texttt{meta-json}]
JSON representation of all of the document's metadata. Field values are
transformed to the selected output format.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{language-variables}{%
\subsection{Language variables}\label{language-variables}}

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{lang}]
identifies the main language of the document, using a code according to
\href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47}{BCP 47} (e.g. \texttt{en} or
\texttt{en-GB}). For some output formats, pandoc will convert it to an
appropriate format stored in the additional variables
\texttt{babel-lang}, \texttt{polyglossia-lang} (LaTeX) and
\texttt{context-lang} (ConTeXt).

Native pandoc Spans and Divs with the lang attribute (value in BCP 47)
can be used to switch the language in that range. In LaTeX output,
\texttt{babel-otherlangs} and \texttt{polyglossia-otherlangs} variables
will be generated automatically based on the \texttt{lang} attributes of
Spans and Divs in the document.
\item[\texttt{dir}]
the base direction of the document, either \texttt{rtl} (right-to-left)
or \texttt{ltr} (left-to-right).

For bidirectional documents, native pandoc \texttt{span}s and
\texttt{div}s with the \texttt{dir} attribute (value \texttt{rtl} or
\texttt{ltr}) can be used to override the base direction in some output
formats. This may not always be necessary if the final renderer
(e.g.~the browser, when generating HTML) supports the
\href{http://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics}{Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm}.

When using LaTeX for bidirectional documents, only the \texttt{xelatex}
engine is fully supported (use \texttt{-\/-pdf-engine=xelatex}).

\hypertarget{using-variables-in-templates}{%
\subsection{Using variables in
templates}\label{using-variables-in-templates}}

Variable names are sequences of alphanumerics, \texttt{-}, and
\texttt{\_}, starting with a letter. A variable name surrounded by
\texttt{\$} signs will be replaced by its value. For example, the string
\texttt{\$title\$} in

\begin{verbatim}
<title>$title$</title>
\end{verbatim}

will be replaced by the document title.

To write a literal \texttt{\$} in a template, use \texttt{\$\$}.

Templates may contain conditionals. The syntax is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
$if(variable)$
X
$else$
Y
$endif$
\end{verbatim}

This will include \texttt{X} in the template if \texttt{variable} has a
truthy value; otherwise it will include \texttt{Y}. Here a truthy value
is any of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a string that is not entirely white space,
\item
  a non-empty array where the first value is truthy,
\item
  any number (including zero),
\item
  any object,
\item
  the boolean \texttt{true} (to specify the boolean \texttt{true} value
  using YAML metadata or the \texttt{-\/-metadata} flag, use \texttt{y},
  \texttt{Y}, \texttt{yes}, \texttt{Yes}, \texttt{YES}, \texttt{true},
  \texttt{True}, \texttt{TRUE}, \texttt{on}, \texttt{On}, or
  \texttt{ON}; with the \texttt{-\/-variable} flag, simply omit a value
  for the variable, e.g. \texttt{-\/-variable\ draft}).
\end{itemize}

\texttt{X} and \texttt{Y} are placeholders for any valid template text,
and may include interpolated variables or other conditionals. The
\texttt{\$else\$} section may be omitted.

When variables can have multiple values (for example, \texttt{author} in
a multi-author document), you can use the \texttt{\$for\$} keyword:

\begin{verbatim}
$for(author)$
<meta name="author" content="$author$" />
$endfor$
\end{verbatim}

You can optionally specify a separator to be used between consecutive
items:

\begin{verbatim}
$for(author)$$author$$sep$, $endfor$
\end{verbatim}

A dot can be used to select a field of a variable that takes an object
as its value. So, for example:

If you use custom templates, you may need to revise them as pandoc
changes. We recommend tracking the changes in the default templates, and
modifying your custom templates accordingly. An easy way to do this is
to fork the
\href{https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates}{pandoc-templates}
repository and merge in changes after each pandoc release.

Templates may contain comments: anything on a line after \texttt{\$-\/-}
will be treated as a comment and ignored.

\hypertarget{extensions}{%
\section{Extensions}\label{extensions}}

The behavior of some of the readers and writers can be adjusted by
enabling or disabling various extensions.

An extension can be enabled by adding \texttt{+EXTENSION} to the format
name and disabled by adding \texttt{-EXTENSION}. For example,
\texttt{-\/-from\ markdown\_strict+footnotes} is strict Markdown with
footnotes enabled, while
\texttt{-\/-from\ markdown-footnotes-pipe\_tables} is pandoc's Markdown
without footnotes or pipe tables.

The markdown reader and writer make by far the most use of extensions.
Extensions only used by them are therefore covered in the section
\protect\hyperlink{pandocs-markdown}{Pandoc's Markdown} below (See
\protect\hyperlink{markdown-variants}{Markdown variants} for
\texttt{commonmark} and \texttt{gfm}.) In the following, extensions that
also work for other formats are covered.

\hypertarget{typography}{%
\subsection{Typography}\label{typography}}

\hypertarget{extension-smart}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{smart}}{Extension: smart}}\label{extension-smart}}

Interpret straight quotes as curly quotes, \texttt{-\/-\/-} as
em-dashes, \texttt{-\/-} as en-dashes, and \texttt{...} as ellipses.
Nonbreaking spaces are inserted after certain abbreviations, such as
``Mr.''

This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[input formats]
\texttt{markdown}, \texttt{commonmark}, \texttt{latex},
\texttt{mediawiki}, \texttt{org}, \texttt{rst}, \texttt{twiki}
\item[output formats]
\texttt{markdown}, \texttt{latex}, \texttt{context}, \texttt{rst}
\item[enabled by default in]
\texttt{markdown}, \texttt{latex}, \texttt{context} (both input and
output)
\end{description}

Note: If you are \emph{writing} Markdown, then the \texttt{smart}
extension has the reverse effect: what would have been curly quotes
comes out straight.

In LaTeX, \texttt{smart} means to use the standard TeX ligatures for
quotation marks (\texttt{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{}} for double quotes,
\texttt{\textasciigrave{}} and \texttt{\textquotesingle{}} for single
quotes) and dashes (\texttt{-\/-} for en-dash and \texttt{-\/-\/-} for
em-dash). If \texttt{smart} is disabled, then in reading LaTeX pandoc
will parse these characters literally. In writing LaTeX, enabling
\texttt{smart} tells pandoc to use the ligatures when possible; if
\texttt{smart} is disabled pandoc will use unicode quotation mark and
dash characters.

\hypertarget{headers-and-sections}{%
\subsection{Headers and sections}\label{headers-and-sections}}

\hypertarget{extension-auto_identifiers}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{auto\_identifiers}}{Extension: auto\_identifiers}}\label{extension-auto_identifiers}}

A header without an explicitly specified identifier will be
automatically assigned a unique identifier based on the header text.

This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[input formats]
\texttt{markdown}, \texttt{latex}, \texttt{rst}, \texttt{mediawiki},
\texttt{textile}
\item[output formats]
\texttt{markdown}, \texttt{muse}
\item[enabled by default in]
\texttt{markdown}, \texttt{muse}
\end{description}

The algorithm used to derive the identifier from the header text is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Remove all formatting, links, etc.
\item
  Remove all footnotes.
\item
  Remove all punctuation, except underscores, hyphens, and periods.
\item
  Replace all spaces and newlines with hyphens.
\item
  Convert all alphabetic characters to lowercase.
\item
  Remove everything up to the first letter (identifiers may not begin
  with a number or punctuation mark).
\item
  If nothing is left after this, use the identifier \texttt{section}.
\end{itemize}

Thus, for example,

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Header & Identifier\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\texttt{Header\ identifiers\ in\ HTML} &
\texttt{header-identifiers-in-html}\tabularnewline
\texttt{*Dogs*?-\/-in\ *my*\ house?} &
\texttt{dogs-\/-in-my-house}\tabularnewline
\texttt{{[}HTML{]},\ {[}S5{]},\ or\ {[}RTF{]}?} &
\texttt{html-s5-or-rtf}\tabularnewline
\texttt{3.\ Applications} & \texttt{applications}\tabularnewline
\texttt{33} & \texttt{section}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

These rules should, in most cases, allow one to determine the identifier
from the header text. The exception is when several headers have the
same text; in this case, the first will get an identifier as described
above; the second will get the same identifier with \texttt{-1}
appended; the third with \texttt{-2}; and so on.

These identifiers are used to provide link targets in the table of
contents generated by the
\texttt{-\/-toc\textbar{}-\/-table-of-contents} option. They also make
it easy to provide links from one section of a document to another. A
link to this section, for example, might look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
See the section on
[header identifiers](#header-identifiers-in-html-latex-and-context).
\end{verbatim}

Note, however, that this method of providing links to sections works
only in HTML, LaTeX, and ConTeXt formats.

If the \texttt{-\/-section-divs} option is specified, then each section
will be wrapped in a \texttt{section} (or a \texttt{div}, if
\texttt{html4} was specified), and the identifier will be attached to
the enclosing \texttt{\textless{}section\textgreater{}} (or
\texttt{\textless{}div\textgreater{}}) tag rather than the header
itself. This allows entire sections to be manipulated using JavaScript
or treated differently in CSS.

\hypertarget{extension-ascii_identifiers}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{ascii\_identifiers}}{Extension: ascii\_identifiers}}\label{extension-ascii_identifiers}}

Causes the identifiers produced by \texttt{auto\_identifiers} to be pure
ASCII. Accents are stripped off of accented Latin letters, and non-Latin
letters are omitted.

\hypertarget{math-input}{%
\subsection{Math Input}\label{math-input}}

The extensions
\protect\hyperlink{extension-tex_math_dollars}{\texttt{tex\_math\_dollars}},
\protect\hyperlink{extension-tex_math_single_backslash}{\texttt{tex\_math\_single\_backslash}},
and
\protect\hyperlink{extension-tex_math_double_backslash}{\texttt{tex\_math\_double\_backslash}}
are described in the section about Pandoc's Markdown.

However, they can also be used with HTML input. This is handy for
reading web pages formatted using MathJax, for example.

\hypertarget{raw-htmltex}{%
\subsection{Raw HTML/TeX}\label{raw-htmltex}}

The following extensions (especially how they affect Markdown
input/output) are also described in more detail in their respective
sections of \protect\hyperlink{pandocs-markdown}{Pandoc's Markdown}.

\hypertarget{raw_html}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\protect\hyperlink{extension-raw_html}{Extension:
\texttt{raw\_html}}}{Extension: raw\_html}}\label{raw_html}}

When converting from HTML, parse elements to raw HTML which are not
representable in pandoc's AST. By default, this is disabled for HTML
input.

\hypertarget{raw_tex}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\protect\hyperlink{extension-raw_tex}{Extension:
\texttt{raw\_tex}}}{Extension: raw\_tex}}\label{raw_tex}}

Allows raw LaTeX, TeX, and ConTeXt to be included in a document.

This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats (in
addition to \texttt{markdown}):

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[input formats]
\texttt{latex}, \texttt{org}, \texttt{textile}
\item[output formats]
\texttt{textile}
\end{description}

\hypertarget{native_divs}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\protect\hyperlink{extension-native_divs}{Extension:
\texttt{native\_divs}}}{Extension: native\_divs}}\label{native_divs}}

This extension is enabled by default for HTML input. This means that
\texttt{div}s are parsed to pandoc native elements. (Alternatively, you
can parse them to raw HTML using
\texttt{-f\ html-native\_divs+raw\_html}.)

When converting HTML to Markdown, for example, you may want to drop all
\texttt{div}s and \texttt{span}s:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -f html-native_divs-native_spans -t markdown
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{native_spans}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\protect\hyperlink{extension-native_spans}{Extension:
\texttt{native\_spans}}}{Extension: native\_spans}}\label{native_spans}}

Analogous to \texttt{native\_divs} above.

\hypertarget{literate-haskell-support}{%
\subsection{Literate Haskell support}\label{literate-haskell-support}}

\hypertarget{extension-literate_haskell}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{literate\_haskell}}{Extension: literate\_haskell}}\label{extension-literate_haskell}}

Treat the document as literate Haskell source.

This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[input formats]
\texttt{markdown}, \texttt{rst}, \texttt{latex}
\item[output formats]
\texttt{markdown}, \texttt{rst}, \texttt{latex}, \texttt{html}
\end{description}

If you append \texttt{+lhs} (or \texttt{+literate\_haskell}) to one of
the formats above, pandoc will treat the document as literate Haskell
source. This means that

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In Markdown input, ``bird track'' sections will be parsed as Haskell
  code rather than block quotations. Text between
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{code\}} and
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{code\}} will also be treated as Haskell
  code. For ATX-style headers the character `=' will be used instead of
  `\#'.
\item
  In Markdown output, code blocks with classes \texttt{haskell} and
  \texttt{literate} will be rendered using bird tracks, and block
  quotations will be indented one space, so they will not be treated as
  Haskell code. In addition, headers will be rendered setext-style (with
  underlines) rather than ATX-style (with `\#' characters). (This is
  because ghc treats `\#' characters in column 1 as introducing line
  numbers.)
\item
  In restructured text input, ``bird track'' sections will be parsed as
  Haskell code.
\item
  In restructured text output, code blocks with class \texttt{haskell}
  will be rendered using bird tracks.
\item
  In LaTeX input, text in \texttt{code} environments will be parsed as
  Haskell code.
\item
  In LaTeX output, code blocks with class \texttt{haskell} will be
  rendered inside \texttt{code} environments.
\item
  In HTML output, code blocks with class \texttt{haskell} will be
  rendered with class \texttt{literatehaskell} and bird tracks.
\end{itemize}

Examples:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -f markdown+lhs -t html
\end{verbatim}

reads literate Haskell source formatted with Markdown conventions and
writes ordinary HTML (without bird tracks).

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -f markdown+lhs -t html+lhs
\end{verbatim}

writes HTML with the Haskell code in bird tracks, so it can be copied
and pasted as literate Haskell source.

Note that GHC expects the bird tracks in the first column, so indented
literate code blocks (e.g.~inside an itemized environment) will not be
picked up by the Haskell compiler.

\hypertarget{other-extensions}{%
\subsection{Other extensions}\label{other-extensions}}

\hypertarget{extension-empty_paragraphs}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{empty\_paragraphs}}{Extension: empty\_paragraphs}}\label{extension-empty_paragraphs}}

Allows empty paragraphs. By default empty paragraphs are omitted.

This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[input formats]
\texttt{docx}, \texttt{html}
\item[output formats]
\texttt{docx}, \texttt{odt}, \texttt{opendocument}, \texttt{html}
\end{description}

\hypertarget{ext-styles}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{styles}}{Extension: styles}}\label{ext-styles}}

Read all docx styles as divs (for paragraph styles) and spans (for
character styles) regardless of whether pandoc understands the meaning
of these styles. This can be used with
\protect\hyperlink{custom-styles-in-docx}{docx custom styles}. Disabled
by default.

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[input formats]
\texttt{docx}
\end{description}

\hypertarget{extension-amuse}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{amuse}}{Extension: amuse}}\label{extension-amuse}}

In the \texttt{muse} input format, this enables Text::Amuse extensions
to Emacs Muse markup.

\hypertarget{org-citations}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{citations}}{Extension: citations}}\label{org-citations}}

Some aspects of \protect\hyperlink{citations}{Pandoc's Markdown citation
syntax} are also accepted in \texttt{org} input.

\hypertarget{extension-ntb}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{ntb}}{Extension: ntb}}\label{extension-ntb}}

In the \texttt{context} output format this enables the use of
\href{http://wiki.contextgarden.net/TABLE}{Natural Tables (TABLE)}
instead of the default
\href{http://wiki.contextgarden.net/xtables}{Extreme Tables (xtables)}.
Natural tables allow more fine-grained global customization but come at
a performance penalty compared to extreme tables.

\hypertarget{pandocs-markdown}{%
\section{Pandoc's Markdown}\label{pandocs-markdown}}

Pandoc understands an extended and slightly revised version of John
Gruber's \href{http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}{Markdown}
syntax. This document explains the syntax, noting differences from
standard Markdown. Except where noted, these differences can be
suppressed by using the \texttt{markdown\_strict} format instead of
\texttt{markdown}. Extensions can be enabled or disabled to specify the
behavior more granularly. They are described in the following. See also
\protect\hyperlink{extensions}{Extensions} above, for extensions that
work also on other formats.

\hypertarget{philosophy}{%
\subsection{Philosophy}\label{philosophy}}

Markdown is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly,
easy to read:

\begin{quote}
A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain
text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting
instructions. --
\href{http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\#philosophy}{John
Gruber}
\end{quote}

This principle has guided pandoc's decisions in finding syntax for
tables, footnotes, and other extensions.

There is, however, one respect in which pandoc's aims are different from
the original aims of Markdown. Whereas Markdown was originally designed
with HTML generation in mind, pandoc is designed for multiple output
formats. Thus, while pandoc allows the embedding of raw HTML, it
discourages it, and provides other, non-HTMLish ways of representing
important document elements like definition lists, tables, mathematics,
and footnotes.

\hypertarget{paragraphs}{%
\subsection{Paragraphs}\label{paragraphs}}

A paragraph is one or more lines of text followed by one or more blank
lines. Newlines are treated as spaces, so you can reflow your paragraphs
as you like. If you need a hard line break, put two or more spaces at
the end of a line.

\hypertarget{extension-escaped_line_breaks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{escaped\_line\_breaks}}{Extension: escaped\_line\_breaks}}\label{extension-escaped_line_breaks}}

A backslash followed by a newline is also a hard line break. Note: in
multiline and grid table cells, this is the only way to create a hard
line break, since trailing spaces in the cells are ignored.

\hypertarget{headers}{%
\subsection{Headers}\label{headers}}

There are two kinds of headers: Setext and ATX.

\hypertarget{setext-style-headers}{%
\subsubsection{Setext-style headers}\label{setext-style-headers}}

A setext-style header is a line of text ``underlined'' with a row of
\texttt{=} signs (for a level one header) or \texttt{-} signs (for a
level two header):

\begin{verbatim}
A level-one header
==================

A level-two header
------------------
\end{verbatim}

The header text can contain inline formatting, such as emphasis (see
\protect\hyperlink{inline-formatting}{Inline formatting}, below).

\hypertarget{atx-style-headers}{%
\subsubsection{ATX-style headers}\label{atx-style-headers}}

An ATX-style header consists of one to six \texttt{\#} signs and a line
of text, optionally followed by any number of \texttt{\#} signs. The
number of \texttt{\#} signs at the beginning of the line is the header
level:

\begin{verbatim}
## A level-two header

### A level-three header ###
\end{verbatim}

As with setext-style headers, the header text can contain formatting:

\begin{verbatim}
# A level-one header with a [link](/url) and *emphasis*
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-blank_before_header}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{blank\_before\_header}}{Extension: blank\_before\_header}}\label{extension-blank_before_header}}

Standard Markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a header.
Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at the beginning of the
document). The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy for
a \texttt{\#} to end up at the beginning of a line by accident (perhaps
through line wrapping). Consider, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
I like several of their flavors of ice cream:
#22, for example, and #5.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-space_in_atx_header}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{space\_in\_atx\_header}}{Extension: space\_in\_atx\_header}}\label{extension-space_in_atx_header}}

Many Markdown implementations do not require a space between the opening
\texttt{\#}s of an ATX header and the header text, so that
\texttt{\#5\ bolt} and \texttt{\#hashtag} count as headers. With this
extension, pandoc does require the space.

\hypertarget{header-identifiers}{%
\subsubsection{Header identifiers}\label{header-identifiers}}

See also the
\protect\hyperlink{extension-auto_identifiers}{\texttt{auto\_identifiers}
extension} above.

\hypertarget{extension-header_attributes}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{header\_attributes}}{Extension: header\_attributes}}\label{extension-header_attributes}}

Headers can be assigned attributes using this syntax at the end of the
line containing the header text:

\begin{verbatim}
{#identifier .class .class key=value key=value}
\end{verbatim}

Thus, for example, the following headers will all be assigned the
identifier \texttt{foo}:

\begin{verbatim}
# My header {#foo}

## My header ##    {#foo}

My other header   {#foo}
---------------
\end{verbatim}

(This syntax is compatible with
\href{https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/}{PHP Markdown
Extra}.)

Note that although this syntax allows assignment of classes and
key/value attributes, writers generally don't use all of this
information. Identifiers, classes, and key/value attributes are used in
HTML and HTML-based formats such as EPUB and slidy. Identifiers are used
for labels and link anchors in the LaTeX, ConTeXt, Textile, and AsciiDoc
writers.

Headers with the class \texttt{unnumbered} will not be numbered, even if
\texttt{-\/-number-sections} is specified. A single hyphen (\texttt{-})
in an attribute context is equivalent to \texttt{.unnumbered}, and
preferable in non-English documents. So,

\begin{verbatim}
# My header {-}
\end{verbatim}

is just the same as

\begin{verbatim}
# My header {.unnumbered}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-implicit_header_references}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{implicit\_header\_references}}{Extension: implicit\_header\_references}}\label{extension-implicit_header_references}}

Pandoc behaves as if reference links have been defined for each header.
So, to link to a header

\begin{verbatim}
# Header identifiers in HTML
\end{verbatim}

you can simply write

\begin{verbatim}
[Header identifiers in HTML]
\end{verbatim}

or

\begin{verbatim}
[Header identifiers in HTML][]
\end{verbatim}

or

\begin{verbatim}
[the section on header identifiers][header identifiers in
HTML]
\end{verbatim}

instead of giving the identifier explicitly:

\begin{verbatim}
[Header identifiers in HTML](#header-identifiers-in-html)
\end{verbatim}

If there are multiple headers with identical text, the corresponding
reference will link to the first one only, and you will need to use
explicit links to link to the others, as described above.

Like regular reference links, these references are case-insensitive.

Explicit link reference definitions always take priority over implicit
header references. So, in the following example, the link will point to
\texttt{bar}, not to \texttt{\#foo}:

\begin{verbatim}
# Foo

[foo]: bar

See [foo]
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{block-quotations}{%
\subsection{Block quotations}\label{block-quotations}}

Markdown uses email conventions for quoting blocks of text. A block
quotation is one or more paragraphs or other block elements (such as
lists or headers), with each line preceded by a \texttt{\textgreater{}}
character and an optional space. (The \texttt{\textgreater{}} need not
start at the left margin, but it should not be indented more than three
spaces.)

\begin{verbatim}
> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.
\end{verbatim}

A ``lazy'' form, which requires the \texttt{\textgreater{}} character
only on the first line of each block, is also allowed:

\begin{verbatim}
> This is a block quote. This
paragraph has two lines.

> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
2. Second item.
\end{verbatim}

Among the block elements that can be contained in a block quote are
other block quotes. That is, block quotes can be nested:

\begin{verbatim}
> This is a block quote.
>
> > A block quote within a block quote.
\end{verbatim}

If the \texttt{\textgreater{}} character is followed by an optional
space, that space will be considered part of the block quote marker and
not part of the indentation of the contents. Thus, to put an indented
code block in a block quote, you need five spaces after the
\texttt{\textgreater{}}:

\begin{verbatim}
>     code
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-blank_before_blockquote}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{blank\_before\_blockquote}}{Extension: blank\_before\_blockquote}}\label{extension-blank_before_blockquote}}

Standard Markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a block
quote. Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at the beginning of
the document). The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy
for a \texttt{\textgreater{}} to end up at the beginning of a line by
accident (perhaps through line wrapping). So, unless the
\texttt{markdown\_strict} format is used, the following does not produce
a nested block quote in pandoc:

\begin{verbatim}
> This is a block quote.
>> Nested.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{verbatim-code-blocks}{%
\subsection{Verbatim (code) blocks}\label{verbatim-code-blocks}}

\hypertarget{indented-code-blocks}{%
\subsubsection{Indented code blocks}\label{indented-code-blocks}}

A block of text indented four spaces (or one tab) is treated as verbatim
text: that is, special characters do not trigger special formatting, and
all spaces and line breaks are preserved. For example,

\begin{verbatim}
    if (a > 3) {
      moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
    }
\end{verbatim}

The initial (four space or one tab) indentation is not considered part
of the verbatim text, and is removed in the output.

Note: blank lines in the verbatim text need not begin with four spaces.

\hypertarget{fenced-code-blocks}{%
\subsubsection{Fenced code blocks}\label{fenced-code-blocks}}

\hypertarget{extension-fenced_code_blocks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{fenced\_code\_blocks}}{Extension: fenced\_code\_blocks}}\label{extension-fenced_code_blocks}}

In addition to standard indented code blocks, pandoc supports
\emph{fenced} code blocks. These begin with a row of three or more
tildes (\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}) and end with a row of tildes that
must be at least as long as the starting row. Everything between these
lines is treated as code. No indentation is necessary:

\begin{verbatim}
~~~~~~~
if (a > 3) {
  moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
}
~~~~~~~
\end{verbatim}

Like regular code blocks, fenced code blocks must be separated from
surrounding text by blank lines.

If the code itself contains a row of tildes or backticks, just use a
longer row of tildes or backticks at the start and end:

\begin{verbatim}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
code including tildes
~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-backtick_code_blocks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{backtick\_code\_blocks}}{Extension: backtick\_code\_blocks}}\label{extension-backtick_code_blocks}}

Same as \texttt{fenced\_code\_blocks}, but uses backticks
(\texttt{\textasciigrave{}}) instead of tildes
(\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}).

\hypertarget{extension-fenced_code_attributes}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{fenced\_code\_attributes}}{Extension: fenced\_code\_attributes}}\label{extension-fenced_code_attributes}}

Optionally, you may attach attributes to fenced or backtick code block
using this syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
~~~~ {#mycode .haskell .numberLines startFrom="100"}
qsort []     = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort (filter (< x) xs) ++ [x] ++
               qsort (filter (>= x) xs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\end{verbatim}

Here \texttt{mycode} is an identifier, \texttt{haskell} and
\texttt{numberLines} are classes, and \texttt{startFrom} is an attribute
with value \texttt{100}. Some output formats can use this information to
do syntax highlighting. Currently, the only output formats that uses
this information are HTML, LaTeX, Docx, Ms, and PowerPoint. If
highlighting is supported for your output format and language, then the
code block above will appear highlighted, with numbered lines. (To see
which languages are supported, type
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-list-highlight-languages}.) Otherwise, the code
block above will appear as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
<pre id="mycode" class="haskell numberLines" startFrom="100">
  <code>
  ...
  </code>
</pre>
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{numberLines} (or \texttt{number-lines}) class will cause the
lines of the code block to be numbered, starting with \texttt{1} or the
value of the \texttt{startFrom} attribute. The \texttt{lineAnchors} (or
\texttt{line-anchors}) class will cause the lines to be clickable
anchors in HTML output.

A shortcut form can also be used for specifying the language of the code
block:

\begin{verbatim}
```haskell
qsort [] = []
```
\end{verbatim}

This is equivalent to:

\begin{verbatim}
``` {.haskell}
qsort [] = []
```
\end{verbatim}

If the \texttt{fenced\_code\_attributes} extension is disabled, but
input contains class attribute(s) for the code block, the first class
attribute will be printed after the opening fence as a bare word.

To prevent all highlighting, use the \texttt{-\/-no-highlight} flag. To
set the highlighting style, use \texttt{-\/-highlight-style}. For more
information on highlighting, see
\protect\hyperlink{syntax-highlighting}{Syntax highlighting}, below.

\hypertarget{line-blocks}{%
\subsection{Line blocks}\label{line-blocks}}

\hypertarget{extension-line_blocks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{line\_blocks}}{Extension: line\_blocks}}\label{extension-line_blocks}}

A line block is a sequence of lines beginning with a vertical bar
(\texttt{\textbar{}}) followed by a space. The division into lines will
be preserved in the output, as will any leading spaces; otherwise, the
lines will be formatted as Markdown. This is useful for verse and
addresses:

\begin{verbatim}

| In space that is quite economical.

\end{verbatim}

The lines can be hard-wrapped if needed, but the continuation line must
begin with a space.

\begin{verbatim}
| The Right Honorable Most Venerable and Righteous Samuel L.
  Constable, Jr.
| 200 Main St.
| Berkeley, CA 94718
\end{verbatim}

This syntax is borrowed from
\href{http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html}{reStructuredText}.

\hypertarget{lists}{%
\subsection{Lists}\label{lists}}

\hypertarget{bullet-lists}{%
\subsubsection{Bullet lists}\label{bullet-lists}}

A bullet list is a list of bulleted list items. A bulleted list item
begins with a bullet (\texttt{*}, \texttt{+}, or \texttt{-}). Here is a
simple example:

\begin{verbatim}
* one
* two
* three
\end{verbatim}

This will produce a ``compact'' list. If you want a ``loose'' list, in
which each item is formatted as a paragraph, put spaces between the
items:

\begin{verbatim}
* one

* two

* three
\end{verbatim}

The bullets need not be flush with the left margin; they may be indented
one, two, or three spaces. The bullet must be followed by whitespace.

List items look best if subsequent lines are flush with the first line
(after the bullet):

\begin{verbatim}
* here is my first
  list item.
* and my second.
\end{verbatim}

But Markdown also allows a ``lazy'' format:

\begin{verbatim}
* here is my first
list item.
* and my second.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{block-content-in-list-items}{%
\subsubsection{Block content in list
items}\label{block-content-in-list-items}}

A list item may contain multiple paragraphs and other block-level
content. However, subsequent paragraphs must be preceded by a blank line
and indented to line up with the first non-space content after the list
marker.

\begin{verbatim}
  * First paragraph.

    Continued.

  * Second paragraph. With a code block, which must be indented
    eight spaces:

        { code }
\end{verbatim}

Exception: if the list marker is followed by an indented code block,
which must begin 5 spaces after the list marker, then subsequent
paragraphs must begin two columns after the last character of the list
marker:

\begin{verbatim}
*     code

  continuation paragraph
\end{verbatim}

List items may include other lists. In this case the preceding blank
line is optional. The nested list must be indented to line up with the
first non-space character after the list marker of the containing list
item.

\begin{verbatim}
* fruits
  + apples
    - macintosh
    - red delicious
  + pears
  + peaches
* vegetables
  + broccoli
  + chard
\end{verbatim}

As noted above, Markdown allows you to write list items ``lazily,''
instead of indenting continuation lines. However, if there are multiple
paragraphs or other blocks in a list item, the first line of each must
be indented.

\begin{verbatim}
+ A lazy, lazy, list
item.

+ Another one; this looks
bad but is legal.

    Second paragraph of second
list item.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{ordered-lists}{%
\subsubsection{Ordered lists}\label{ordered-lists}}

Ordered lists work just like bulleted lists, except that the items begin
with enumerators rather than bullets.

In standard Markdown, enumerators are decimal numbers followed by a
period and a space. The numbers themselves are ignored, so there is no
difference between this list:

\begin{verbatim}
1.  one
2.  two
3.  three
\end{verbatim}

and this one:

\begin{verbatim}
5.  one
7.  two
1.  three
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-fancy_lists}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{fancy\_lists}}{Extension: fancy\_lists}}\label{extension-fancy_lists}}

Unlike standard Markdown, pandoc allows ordered list items to be marked
with uppercase and lowercase letters and roman numerals, in addition to
Arabic numerals. List markers may be enclosed in parentheses or followed
by a single right-parentheses or period. They must be separated from the
text that follows by at least one space, and, if the list marker is a
capital letter with a period, by at least two spaces.\footnote{The point
  of this rule is to ensure that normal paragraphs starting with
  people's initials, like

\begin{Verbatim}
B. Russell was an English philosopher.
\end{Verbatim}

  do not get treated as list items.

  This rule will not prevent

\begin{Verbatim}
(C) 2007 Joe Smith
\end{Verbatim}

  from being interpreted as a list item. In this case, a backslash
  escape can be used:

\begin{Verbatim}
(C\) 2007 Joe Smith
\end{Verbatim}
}

The \texttt{fancy\_lists} extension also allows `\texttt{\#}' to be used
as an ordered list marker in place of a numeral:

\begin{verbatim}
#. one
#. two
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-startnum}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{startnum}}{Extension: startnum}}\label{extension-startnum}}

Pandoc also pays attention to the type of list marker used, and to the
starting number, and both of these are preserved where possible in the
output format. Thus, the following yields a list with numbers followed
by a single parenthesis, starting with 9, and a sublist with lowercase
roman numerals:

\begin{verbatim}
 9)  Ninth
10)  Tenth
11)  Eleventh
       i. subone
      ii. subtwo
     iii. subthree
\end{verbatim}

Pandoc will start a new list each time a different type of list marker
is used. So, the following will create three lists:

\begin{verbatim}
(2) Two
(5) Three
1.  Four
*   Five
\end{verbatim}

If default list markers are desired, use \texttt{\#.}:

\begin{verbatim}
#.  one
#.  two
#.  three
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{definition-lists}{%
\subsubsection{Definition lists}\label{definition-lists}}

\hypertarget{extension-definition_lists}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{definition\_lists}}{Extension: definition\_lists}}\label{extension-definition_lists}}

Pandoc supports definition lists, using the syntax of
\href{https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/}{PHP Markdown
Extra} with some extensions.\footnote{I have been influenced by the
  suggestions of
  \href{http://www.justatheory.com/computers/markup/modest-markdown-proposal.html}{David
  Wheeler}.}

\begin{verbatim}
Term 1

:   Definition 1

Term 2 with *inline markup*

:   Definition 2

        { some code, part of Definition 2 }

    Third paragraph of definition 2.
\end{verbatim}

Each term must fit on one line, which may optionally be followed by a
blank line, and must be followed by one or more definitions. A
definition begins with a colon or tilde, which may be indented one or
two spaces.

A term may have multiple definitions, and each definition may consist of
one or more block elements (paragraph, code block, list, etc.), each
indented four spaces or one tab stop. The body of the definition
(including the first line, aside from the colon or tilde) should be
indented four spaces. However, as with other Markdown lists, you can
``lazily'' omit indentation except at the beginning of a paragraph or
other block element:

\begin{verbatim}
Term 1

:   Definition
with lazy continuation.

    Second paragraph of the definition.
\end{verbatim}

If you leave space before the definition (as in the example above), the
text of the definition will be treated as a paragraph. In some output
formats, this will mean greater spacing between term/definition pairs.
For a more compact definition list, omit the space before the
definition:

\begin{verbatim}
Term 1
  ~ Definition 1

Term 2
  ~ Definition 2a
  ~ Definition 2b
\end{verbatim}

Note that space between items in a definition list is required. (A
variant that loosens this requirement, but disallows ``lazy'' hard
wrapping, can be activated with \texttt{compact\_definition\_lists}: see
\protect\hyperlink{non-pandoc-extensions}{Non-pandoc extensions},
below.)

\hypertarget{numbered-example-lists}{%
\subsubsection{Numbered example lists}\label{numbered-example-lists}}

\hypertarget{extension-example_lists}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{example\_lists}}{Extension: example\_lists}}\label{extension-example_lists}}

The special list marker \texttt{@} can be used for sequentially numbered
examples. The first list item with a \texttt{@} marker will be numbered
`1', the next `2', and so on, throughout the document. The numbered
examples need not occur in a single list; each new list using \texttt{@}
will take up where the last stopped. So, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
(@)  My first example will be numbered (1).
(@)  My second example will be numbered (2).

Explanation of examples.

(@)  My third example will be numbered (3).
\end{verbatim}

Numbered examples can be labeled and referred to elsewhere in the
document:

\begin{verbatim}
(@good)  This is a good example.

As (@good) illustrates, ...
\end{verbatim}

The label can be any string of alphanumeric characters, underscores, or
hyphens.

Note: continuation paragraphs in example lists must always be indented
four spaces, regardless of the length of the list marker. That is,
example lists always behave as if the \texttt{four\_space\_rule}
extension is set. This is because example labels tend to be long, and
indenting content to the first non-space character after the label would
be awkward.

\hypertarget{compact-and-loose-lists}{%
\subsubsection{Compact and loose lists}\label{compact-and-loose-lists}}

Pandoc behaves differently from \texttt{Markdown.pl} on some ``edge
cases'' involving lists. Consider this source:

\begin{verbatim}
+   First
+   Second:
    -   Fee
    -   Fie
    -   Foe

+   Third
\end{verbatim}

Pandoc transforms this into a ``compact list'' (with no
\texttt{\textless{}p\textgreater{}} tags around ``First'', ``Second'',
or ``Third''), while Markdown puts \texttt{\textless{}p\textgreater{}}
tags around ``Second'' and ``Third'' (but not ``First''), because of the
blank space around ``Third''. Pandoc follows a simple rule: if the text
is followed by a blank line, it is treated as a paragraph. Since
``Second'' is followed by a list, and not a blank line, it isn't treated
as a paragraph. The fact that the list is followed by a blank line is
irrelevant. (Note: Pandoc works this way even when the
\texttt{markdown\_strict} format is specified. This behavior is
consistent with the official Markdown syntax description, even though it
is different from that of \texttt{Markdown.pl}.)

\hypertarget{ending-a-list}{%
\subsubsection{Ending a list}\label{ending-a-list}}

What if you want to put an indented code block after a list?

\begin{verbatim}
-   item one
-   item two

    { my code block }
\end{verbatim}

Trouble! Here pandoc (like other Markdown implementations) will treat
\texttt{\{\ my\ code\ block\ \}} as the second paragraph of item two,
and not as a code block.

To ``cut off'' the list after item two, you can insert some non-indented
content, like an HTML comment, which won't produce visible output in any
format:

\begin{verbatim}
-   item one
-   item two

<!-- end of list -->

    { my code block }
\end{verbatim}

You can use the same trick if you want two consecutive lists instead of
one big list:

\begin{verbatim}
1.  one
2.  two
3.  three

<!-- -->

1.  uno
2.  dos
3.  tres
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{horizontal-rules}{%
\subsection{Horizontal rules}\label{horizontal-rules}}

A line containing a row of three or more \texttt{*}, \texttt{-}, or
\texttt{\_} characters (optionally separated by spaces) produces a
horizontal rule:

\begin{verbatim}
*  *  *  *

---------------
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{tables}{%
\subsection{Tables}\label{tables}}

Four kinds of tables may be used. The first three kinds presuppose the
use of a fixed-width font, such as Courier. The fourth kind can be used
with proportionally spaced fonts, as it does not require lining up
columns.

\hypertarget{extension-table_captions}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{table\_captions}}{Extension: table\_captions}}\label{extension-table_captions}}

A caption may optionally be provided with all 4 kinds of tables (as
illustrated in the examples below). A caption is a paragraph beginning
with the string \texttt{Table:} (or just \texttt{:}), which will be
stripped off. It may appear either before or after the table.

\hypertarget{extension-simple_tables}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{simple\_tables}}{Extension: simple\_tables}}\label{extension-simple_tables}}

Simple tables look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1

Table:  Demonstration of simple table syntax.
\end{verbatim}

The headers and table rows must each fit on one line. Column alignments
are determined by the position of the header text relative to the dashed
line below it:\footnote{This scheme is due to Michel Fortin, who
  proposed it on the
  \href{http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2005-March/001097.html}{Markdown
  discussion list}.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the dashed line is flush with the header text on the right side but
  extends beyond it on the left, the column is right-aligned.
\item
  If the dashed line is flush with the header text on the left side but
  extends beyond it on the right, the column is left-aligned.
\item
  If the dashed line extends beyond the header text on both sides, the
  column is centered.
\item
  If the dashed line is flush with the header text on both sides, the
  default alignment is used (in most cases, this will be left).
\end{itemize}

The table must end with a blank line, or a line of dashes followed by a
blank line.

The column headers may be omitted, provided a dashed line is used to end
the table. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12             12
    123     123       123           123
      1     1          1              1
-------     ------ ----------   -------
\end{verbatim}

When headers are omitted, column alignments are determined on the basis
of the first line of the table body. So, in the tables above, the
columns would be right, left, center, and right aligned, respectively.

\hypertarget{extension-multiline_tables}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{multiline\_tables}}{Extension: multiline\_tables}}\label{extension-multiline_tables}}

Multiline tables allow headers and table rows to span multiple lines of
text (but cells that span multiple columns or rows of the table are not
supported). Here is an example:

\begin{verbatim}
-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Here's the caption. It, too, may span
multiple lines.
\end{verbatim}

These work like simple tables, but with the following differences:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  They must begin with a row of dashes, before the header text (unless
  the headers are omitted).
\item
  They must end with a row of dashes, then a blank line.
\item
  The rows must be separated by blank lines.
\end{itemize}

In multiline tables, the table parser pays attention to the widths of
the columns, and the writers try to reproduce these relative widths in
the output. So, if you find that one of the columns is too narrow in the
output, try widening it in the Markdown source.

Headers may be omitted in multiline tables as well as simple tables:

\begin{verbatim}
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------

: Here's a multiline table without headers.
\end{verbatim}

It is possible for a multiline table to have just one row, but the row
should be followed by a blank line (and then the row of dashes that ends
the table), or the table may be interpreted as a simple table.

\hypertarget{extension-grid_tables}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{grid\_tables}}{Extension: grid\_tables}}\label{extension-grid_tables}}

Grid tables look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
: Sample grid table.

+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Fruit         | Price         | Advantages         |
+===============+===============+====================+
| Bananas       | $1.34         | - built-in wrapper |
|               |               | - bright color     |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Oranges       | $2.10         | - cures scurvy     |
|               |               | - tasty            |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
\end{verbatim}

The row of \texttt{=}s separates the header from the table body, and can
be omitted for a headerless table. The cells of grid tables may contain
arbitrary block elements (multiple paragraphs, code blocks, lists,
etc.). Cells that span multiple columns or rows are not supported. Grid
tables can be created easily using
\href{http://table.sourceforge.net/}{Emacs table mode}.

Alignments can be specified as with pipe tables, by putting colons at
the boundaries of the separator line after the header:

\begin{verbatim}
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Right         | Left          | Centered           |
+==============:+:==============+:==================:+
| Bananas       | $1.34         | built-in wrapper   |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
\end{verbatim}

For headerless tables, the colons go on the top line instead:

\begin{verbatim}
+--------------:+:--------------+:------------------:+
| Right         | Left          | Centered           |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{grid-table-limitations}{%
\subparagraph{Grid Table Limitations}\label{grid-table-limitations}}

Pandoc does not support grid tables with row spans or column spans. This
means that neither variable numbers of columns across rows nor variable
numbers of rows across columns are supported by Pandoc. All grid tables
must have the same number of columns in each row, and the same number of
rows in each column. For example, the Docutils
\href{http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html\#grid-tables}{sample
grid tables} will not render as expected with Pandoc.

\hypertarget{extension-pipe_tables}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{pipe\_tables}}{Extension: pipe\_tables}}\label{extension-pipe_tables}}

Pipe tables look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
|   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
|  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
|    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

  : Demonstration of pipe table syntax.
\end{verbatim}

The syntax is identical to
\href{https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/\#table}{PHP
Markdown Extra tables}. The beginning and ending pipe characters are
optional, but pipes are required between all columns. The colons
indicate column alignment as shown. The header cannot be omitted. To
simulate a headerless table, include a header with blank cells.

Since the pipes indicate column boundaries, columns need not be
vertically aligned, as they are in the above example. So, this is a
perfectly legal (though ugly) pipe table:

\begin{verbatim}
fruit| price
-----|-----:
apple|2.05
pear|1.37
orange|3.09
\end{verbatim}

The cells of pipe tables cannot contain block elements like paragraphs
and lists, and cannot span multiple lines. If a pipe table contains a
row whose printable content is wider than the column width (see
\texttt{-\/-columns}), then the table will take up the full text width
and the cell contents will wrap, with the relative cell widths
determined by the number of dashes in the line separating the table
header from the table body. (For example \texttt{-\/-\/-\textbar{}-}
would make the first column 3/4 and the second column 1/4 of the full
text width.) On the other hand, if no lines are wider than column width,
then cell contents will not be wrapped, and the cells will be sized to
their contents.

Note: pandoc also recognizes pipe tables of the following form, as can
be produced by Emacs' orgtbl-mode:

\begin{verbatim}
| One | Two   |
|-----+-------|
| my  | table |
| is  | nice  |
\end{verbatim}

The difference is that \texttt{+} is used instead of
\texttt{\textbar{}}. Other orgtbl features are not supported. In
particular, to get non-default column alignment, you'll need to add
colons as above.

\hypertarget{metadata-blocks}{%
\subsection{Metadata blocks}\label{metadata-blocks}}

\hypertarget{extension-pandoc_title_block}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{pandoc\_title\_block}}{Extension: pandoc\_title\_block}}\label{extension-pandoc_title_block}}

If the file begins with a title block

\begin{verbatim}
% title
% author(s) (separated by semicolons)
% date
\end{verbatim}

it will be parsed as bibliographic information, not regular text. (It
will be used, for example, in the title of standalone LaTeX or HTML
output.) The block may contain just a title, a title and an author, or
all three elements. If you want to include an author but no title, or a
title and a date but no author, you need a blank line:

\begin{verbatim}
%
% Author

% My title
%
% June 15, 2006
\end{verbatim}

The title may occupy multiple lines, but continuation lines must begin
with leading space, thus:

\begin{verbatim}
% My title
  on multiple lines
\end{verbatim}

If a document has multiple authors, the authors may be put on separate
lines with leading space, or separated by semicolons, or both. So, all
of the following are equivalent:

\begin{verbatim}
% Author One
  Author Two

% Author One; Author Two

% Author One;
  Author Two
\end{verbatim}

The date must fit on one line.

All three metadata fields may contain standard inline formatting
(italics, links, footnotes, etc.).

Title blocks will always be parsed, but they will affect the output only
when the \texttt{-\/-standalone} (\texttt{-s}) option is chosen. In HTML
output, titles will appear twice: once in the document head -- this is
the title that will appear at the top of the window in a browser -- and
once at the beginning of the document body. The title in the document
head can have an optional prefix attached (\texttt{-\/-title-prefix} or
\texttt{-T} option). The title in the body appears as an H1 element with
class ``title'', so it can be suppressed or reformatted with CSS. If a
title prefix is specified with \texttt{-T} and no title block appears in
the document, the title prefix will be used by itself as the HTML title.

The man page writer extracts a title, man page section number, and other
header and footer information from the title line. The title is assumed
to be the first word on the title line, which may optionally end with a
(single-digit) section number in parentheses. (There should be no space
between the title and the parentheses.) Anything after this is assumed
to be additional footer and header text. A single pipe character
(\texttt{\textbar{}}) should be used to separate the footer text from
the header text. Thus,

\begin{verbatim}
% PANDOC(1)
\end{verbatim}

will yield a man page with the title \texttt{PANDOC} and section 1.

\begin{verbatim}
% PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals
\end{verbatim}

will also have ``Pandoc User Manuals'' in the footer.

\begin{verbatim}
% PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals | Version 4.0
\end{verbatim}

will also have ``Version 4.0'' in the header.

\hypertarget{extension-yaml_metadata_block}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{yaml\_metadata\_block}}{Extension: yaml\_metadata\_block}}\label{extension-yaml_metadata_block}}

A YAML metadata block is a valid YAML object, delimited by a line of
three hyphens (\texttt{-\/-\/-}) at the top and a line of three hyphens
(\texttt{-\/-\/-}) or three dots (\texttt{...}) at the bottom. A YAML
metadata block may occur anywhere in the document, but if it is not at
the beginning, it must be preceded by a blank line. (Note that, because
of the way pandoc concatenates input files when several are provided,
you may also keep the metadata in a separate YAML file and pass it to
pandoc as an argument, along with your Markdown files:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc chap1.md chap2.md chap3.md metadata.yaml -s -o book.html
\end{verbatim}

Just be sure that the YAML file begins with \texttt{-\/-\/-} and ends
with \texttt{-\/-\/-} or \texttt{...}.)

Metadata will be taken from the fields of the YAML object and added to
any existing document metadata. Metadata can contain lists and objects
(nested arbitrarily), but all string scalars will be interpreted as
Markdown. Fields with names ending in an underscore will be ignored by
pandoc. (They may be given a role by external processors.)

A document may contain multiple metadata blocks. The metadata fields
will be combined through a \emph{left-biased union}: if two metadata
blocks attempt to set the same field, the value from the first block
will be taken.

When pandoc is used with \texttt{-t\ markdown} to create a Markdown
document, a YAML metadata block will be produced only if the
\texttt{-s/-\/-standalone} option is used. All of the metadata will
appear in a single block at the beginning of the document.

Note that YAML escaping rules must be followed. Thus, for example, if a
title contains a colon, it must be quoted. The pipe character
(\texttt{\textbar{}}) can be used to begin an indented block that will
be interpreted literally, without need for escaping. This form is
necessary when the field contains blank lines or block-level formatting:

\begin{verbatim}
---
title:  'This is the title: it contains a colon'
author:
- Author One
- Author Two
tags: [nothing, nothingness]
abstract: |
  This is the abstract.

  It consists of two paragraphs.
...
\end{verbatim}

Template variables will be set automatically from the metadata. Thus,
for example, in writing HTML, the variable \texttt{abstract} will be set
to the HTML equivalent of the Markdown in the \texttt{abstract} field:

\begin{verbatim}
<p>This is the abstract.</p>
<p>It consists of two paragraphs.</p>
\end{verbatim}

Variables can contain arbitrary YAML structures, but the template must
match this structure. The \texttt{author} variable in the default
templates expects a simple list or string, but can be changed to support
more complicated structures. The following combination, for example,
would add an affiliation to the author if one is given:

\begin{verbatim}
---
title: The document title
author:
- name: Author One
  affiliation: University of Somewhere
- name: Author Two
  affiliation: University of Nowhere
...
\end{verbatim}

To use the structured authors in the example above, you would need a
custom template:

\begin{verbatim}
$for(author)$
$if(author.name)$
$author.name$$if(author.affiliation)$ ($author.affiliation$)$endif$
$else$
$author$
$endif$
$endfor$
\end{verbatim}

Raw content to include in the document's header may be specified using
\texttt{header-includes}; however, it is important to mark up this
content as raw code for a particular output format, using the
\protect\hyperlink{extension-raw_attribute}{\texttt{raw\_attribute}
extension}), or it will be interpreted as markdown. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
header-includes:
- |
  ```{=latex}
  \let\oldsection\section
  \renewcommand{\section}[1]{\clearpage\oldsection{#1}}
  ```
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{backslash-escapes}{%
\subsection{Backslash escapes}\label{backslash-escapes}}

\hypertarget{extension-all_symbols_escapable}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{all\_symbols\_escapable}}{Extension: all\_symbols\_escapable}}\label{extension-all_symbols_escapable}}

Except inside a code block or inline code, any punctuation or space
character preceded by a backslash will be treated literally, even if it
would normally indicate formatting. Thus, for example, if one writes

\begin{verbatim}
*\*hello\**
\end{verbatim}

one will get

\begin{verbatim}
<em>*hello*</em>
\end{verbatim}

instead of

\begin{verbatim}
<strong>hello</strong>
\end{verbatim}

This rule is easier to remember than standard Markdown's rule, which
allows only the following characters to be backslash-escaped:

\begin{verbatim}
\`*_{}[]()>#+-.!
\end{verbatim}

(However, if the \texttt{markdown\_strict} format is used, the standard
Markdown rule will be used.)

A backslash-escaped space is parsed as a nonbreaking space. It will
appear in TeX output as \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} and in HTML and XML
as \texttt{\textbackslash{}\&\#160;} or
\texttt{\textbackslash{}\&nbsp;}.

A backslash-escaped newline (i.e.~a backslash occurring at the end of a
line) is parsed as a hard line break. It will appear in TeX output as
\texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}} and in HTML as
\texttt{\textless{}br\ /\textgreater{}}. This is a nice alternative to
Markdown's ``invisible'' way of indicating hard line breaks using two
trailing spaces on a line.

Backslash escapes do not work in verbatim contexts.

\hypertarget{inline-formatting}{%
\subsection{Inline formatting}\label{inline-formatting}}

\hypertarget{emphasis}{%
\subsubsection{Emphasis}\label{emphasis}}

To \emph{emphasize} some text, surround it with \texttt{*}s or
\texttt{\_}, like this:

\begin{verbatim}
This text is _emphasized with underscores_, and this
is *emphasized with asterisks*.
\end{verbatim}

Double \texttt{*} or \texttt{\_} produces \textbf{strong emphasis}:

\begin{verbatim}
This is **strong emphasis** and __with underscores__.
\end{verbatim}

A \texttt{*} or \texttt{\_} character surrounded by spaces, or
backslash-escaped, will not trigger emphasis:

\begin{verbatim}
This is * not emphasized *, and \*neither is this\*.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-intraword_underscores}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{intraword\_underscores}}{Extension: intraword\_underscores}}\label{extension-intraword_underscores}}

Because \texttt{\_} is sometimes used inside words and identifiers,
pandoc does not interpret a \texttt{\_} surrounded by alphanumeric
characters as an emphasis marker. If you want to emphasize just part of
a word, use \texttt{*}:

\begin{verbatim}
feas*ible*, not feas*able*.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{strikeout}{%
\subsubsection{Strikeout}\label{strikeout}}

\hypertarget{extension-strikeout}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{strikeout}}{Extension: strikeout}}\label{extension-strikeout}}

To strikeout a section of text with a horizontal line, begin and end it
with \texttt{\textasciitilde{}\textasciitilde{}}. Thus, for example,

\begin{verbatim}
This ~~is deleted text.~~
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{superscripts-and-subscripts}{%
\subsubsection{Superscripts and
subscripts}\label{superscripts-and-subscripts}}

\hypertarget{extension-superscript-subscript}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension: \texttt{superscript},
\texttt{subscript}}{Extension: superscript, subscript}}\label{extension-superscript-subscript}}

Superscripts may be written by surrounding the superscripted text by
\texttt{\^{}} characters; subscripts may be written by surrounding the
subscripted text by \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} characters. Thus, for
example,

\begin{verbatim}
H~2~O is a liquid.  2^10^ is 1024.
\end{verbatim}

If the superscripted or subscripted text contains spaces, these spaces
must be escaped with backslashes. (This is to prevent accidental
superscripting and subscripting through the ordinary use of
\texttt{\textasciitilde{}} and \texttt{\^{}}.) Thus, if you want the
letter P with `a cat' in subscripts, use
\texttt{P\textasciitilde{}a\textbackslash{}\ cat\textasciitilde{}}, not
\texttt{P\textasciitilde{}a\ cat\textasciitilde{}}.

\hypertarget{verbatim}{%
\subsubsection{Verbatim}\label{verbatim}}

To make a short span of text verbatim, put it inside backticks:

\begin{verbatim}
What is the difference between `>>=` and `>>`?
\end{verbatim}

If the verbatim text includes a backtick, use double backticks:

\begin{verbatim}
Here is a literal backtick `` ` ``.
\end{verbatim}

(The spaces after the opening backticks and before the closing backticks
will be ignored.)

The general rule is that a verbatim span starts with a string of
consecutive backticks (optionally followed by a space) and ends with a
string of the same number of backticks (optionally preceded by a space).

Note that backslash-escapes (and other Markdown constructs) do not work
in verbatim contexts:

\begin{verbatim}
This is a backslash followed by an asterisk: `\*`.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-inline_code_attributes}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{inline\_code\_attributes}}{Extension: inline\_code\_attributes}}\label{extension-inline_code_attributes}}

Attributes can be attached to verbatim text, just as with
\protect\hyperlink{fenced-code-blocks}{fenced code blocks}:

\begin{verbatim}
`<$>`{.haskell}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{small-caps}{%
\subsubsection{Small caps}\label{small-caps}}

To write small caps, use the \texttt{smallcaps} class:

\begin{verbatim}
[Small caps]{.smallcaps}
\end{verbatim}

Or, without the \texttt{bracketed\_spans} extension:

\begin{verbatim}
<span class="smallcaps">Small caps</span>
\end{verbatim}

For compatibility with other Markdown flavors, CSS is also supported:

\begin{verbatim}
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small caps</span>
\end{verbatim}

This will work in all output formats that support small caps.

\hypertarget{math}{%
\subsection{Math}\label{math}}

\hypertarget{extension-tex_math_dollars}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{tex\_math\_dollars}}{Extension: tex\_math\_dollars}}\label{extension-tex_math_dollars}}

Anything between two \texttt{\$} characters will be treated as TeX math.
The opening \texttt{\$} must have a non-space character immediately to
its right, while the closing \texttt{\$} must have a non-space character
immediately to its left, and must not be followed immediately by a
digit. Thus, \texttt{\$20,000\ and\ \$30,000} won't parse as math. If
for some reason you need to enclose text in literal \texttt{\$}
characters, backslash-escape them and they won't be treated as math
delimiters.

TeX math will be printed in all output formats. How it is rendered
depends on the output format:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Markdown, LaTeX, Emacs Org mode, ConTeXt, ZimWiki]
It will appear verbatim between \texttt{\$} characters.
\item[reStructuredText]
It will be rendered using an
\href{http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/roles.html\#math}{interpreted
text role \texttt{:math:}}.
\item[AsciiDoc]
It will be rendered as \texttt{latexmath:{[}...{]}}.
\item[Texinfo]
It will be rendered inside a \texttt{@math} command.
\item[groff man]
It will be rendered verbatim without \texttt{\$}'s.
\item[MediaWiki, DokuWiki]
It will be rendered inside \texttt{\textless{}math\textgreater{}} tags.
\item[Textile]
It will be rendered inside
\texttt{\textless{}span\ class="math"\textgreater{}} tags.
\item[RTF, OpenDocument]
It will be rendered, if possible, using Unicode characters, and will
otherwise appear verbatim.
\item[ODT]
It will be rendered, if possible, using MathML.
\item[DocBook]
If the \texttt{-\/-mathml} flag is used, it will be rendered using
MathML in an \texttt{inlineequation} or \texttt{informalequation} tag.
Otherwise it will be rendered, if possible, using Unicode characters.
\item[Docx]
It will be rendered using OMML math markup.
\item[FictionBook2]
If the \texttt{-\/-webtex} option is used, formulas are rendered as
images using CodeCogs or other compatible web service, downloaded and
embedded in the e-book. Otherwise, they will appear verbatim.
\item[HTML, Slidy, DZSlides, S5, EPUB]
The way math is rendered in HTML will depend on the command-line options
selected. Therefore see \protect\hyperlink{math-rendering-in-html}{Math
rendering in HTML} above.
\end{description}

\hypertarget{raw-html}{%
\subsection{Raw HTML}\label{raw-html}}

\hypertarget{extension-raw_html}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{raw\_html}}{Extension: raw\_html}}\label{extension-raw_html}}

Markdown allows you to insert raw HTML (or DocBook) anywhere in a
document (except verbatim contexts, where \texttt{\textless{}},
\texttt{\textgreater{}}, and \texttt{\&} are interpreted literally).
(Technically this is not an extension, since standard Markdown allows
it, but it has been made an extension so that it can be disabled if
desired.)

The raw HTML is passed through unchanged in HTML, S5, Slidy, Slideous,
DZSlides, EPUB, Markdown, Emacs Org mode, and Textile output, and
suppressed in other formats.

\hypertarget{extension-markdown_in_html_blocks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{markdown\_in\_html\_blocks}}{Extension: markdown\_in\_html\_blocks}}\label{extension-markdown_in_html_blocks}}

Standard Markdown allows you to include HTML ``blocks'': blocks of HTML
between balanced tags that are separated from the surrounding text with
blank lines, and start and end at the left margin. Within these blocks,
everything is interpreted as HTML, not Markdown; so (for example),
\texttt{*} does not signify emphasis.

Pandoc behaves this way when the \texttt{markdown\_strict} format is
used; but by default, pandoc interprets material between HTML block tags
as Markdown. Thus, for example, pandoc will turn

\begin{verbatim}
<table>
<tr>
<td>*one*</td>
<td>[a link](http://google.com)</td>
</tr>
</table>
\end{verbatim}

into

\begin{verbatim}
<table>
<tr>
<td><em>one</em></td>
<td><a href="http://google.com">a link</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
\end{verbatim}

whereas \texttt{Markdown.pl} will preserve it as is.

There is one exception to this rule: text between
\texttt{\textless{}script\textgreater{}} and
\texttt{\textless{}style\textgreater{}} tags is not interpreted as
Markdown.

This departure from standard Markdown should make it easier to mix
Markdown with HTML block elements. For example, one can surround a block
of Markdown text with \texttt{\textless{}div\textgreater{}} tags without
preventing it from being interpreted as Markdown.

\hypertarget{extension-native_divs}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{native\_divs}}{Extension: native\_divs}}\label{extension-native_divs}}

Use native pandoc \texttt{Div} blocks for content inside
\texttt{\textless{}div\textgreater{}} tags. For the most part this
should give the same output as \texttt{markdown\_in\_html\_blocks}, but
it makes it easier to write pandoc filters to manipulate groups of
blocks.

\hypertarget{extension-native_spans}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{native\_spans}}{Extension: native\_spans}}\label{extension-native_spans}}

Use native pandoc \texttt{Span} blocks for content inside
\texttt{\textless{}span\textgreater{}} tags. For the most part this
should give the same output as \texttt{raw\_html}, but it makes it
easier to write pandoc filters to manipulate groups of inlines.

\hypertarget{extension-raw_tex}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{raw\_tex}}{Extension: raw\_tex}}\label{extension-raw_tex}}

In addition to raw HTML, pandoc allows raw LaTeX, TeX, and ConTeXt to be
included in a document. Inline TeX commands will be preserved and passed
unchanged to the LaTeX and ConTeXt writers. Thus, for example, you can
use LaTeX to include BibTeX citations:

\begin{verbatim}
This result was proved in \cite{jones.1967}.
\end{verbatim}

Note that in LaTeX environments, like

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
Age & Frequency \\ \hline
18--25  & 15 \\
26--35  & 33 \\
36--45  & 22 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{verbatim}

the material between the begin and end tags will be interpreted as raw
LaTeX, not as Markdown.

Inline LaTeX is ignored in output formats other than Markdown, LaTeX,
Emacs Org mode, and ConTeXt.

\hypertarget{generic-raw-attribute}{%
\subsubsection{Generic raw attribute}\label{generic-raw-attribute}}

\hypertarget{extension-raw_attribute}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{raw\_attribute}}{Extension: raw\_attribute}}\label{extension-raw_attribute}}

Inline spans and fenced code blocks with a special kind of attribute
will be parsed as raw content with the designated format. For example,
the following produces a raw groff \texttt{ms} block:

\begin{verbatim}
```{=ms}
.MYMACRO
blah blah
```
\end{verbatim}

And the following produces a raw \texttt{html} inline element:

\begin{verbatim}
This is `<a>html</a>`{=html}
\end{verbatim}

This can be useful to insert raw xml into \texttt{docx} documents,
e.g.~a pagebreak:

\begin{verbatim}
```{=openxml}
<w:p>
  <w:r>
    <w:br w:type="page"/>
  </w:r>
</w:p>
```
\end{verbatim}

The format name should match the target format name (see
\texttt{-t/-\/-to}, above, for a list, or use
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-list-output-formats}). Use \texttt{openxml} for
\texttt{docx} output, \texttt{opendocument} for \texttt{odt} output,
\texttt{html5} for \texttt{epub3} output, \texttt{html4} for
\texttt{epub2} output, and \texttt{latex}, \texttt{beamer}, \texttt{ms},
or \texttt{html5} for \texttt{pdf} output (depending on what you use for
\texttt{-\/-pdf-engine}).

This extension presupposes that the relevant kind of inline code or
fenced code block is enabled. Thus, for example, to use a raw attribute
with a backtick code block, \texttt{backtick\_code\_blocks} must be
enabled.

The raw attribute cannot be combined with regular attributes.

\hypertarget{latex-macros}{%
\subsection{LaTeX macros}\label{latex-macros}}

\hypertarget{extension-latex_macros}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{latex\_macros}}{Extension: latex\_macros}}\label{extension-latex_macros}}

For output formats other than LaTeX, pandoc will parse LaTeX macro
definitions and apply the resulting macros to all LaTeX math and raw
LaTeX. So, for example, the following will work in all output formats,
not just LaTeX:

\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\tuple}[1]{\langle #1 \rangle}

$\tuple{a, b, c}$
\end{verbatim}

Note that LaTeX macros will not be applied if they occur inside inside a
raw span or block marked with the
\protect\hyperlink{extension-raw_attribute}{\texttt{raw\_attribute}
extension}.

When \texttt{latex\_macros} is disabled, the raw LaTeX and math will not
have macros applied. This is usually a better approach when you are
targeting LaTeX or PDF.

Whether or not \texttt{latex\_macros} is enabled, the macro definitions
will still be passed through as raw LaTeX.

\hypertarget{links}{%
\subsection{Links}\label{links}}

Markdown allows links to be specified in several ways.

\hypertarget{automatic-links}{%
\subsubsection{Automatic links}\label{automatic-links}}

If you enclose a URL or email address in pointy brackets, it will become
a link:

\begin{verbatim}
<http://google.com>
<sam@green.eggs.ham>
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{inline-links}{%
\subsubsection{Inline links}\label{inline-links}}

An inline link consists of the link text in square brackets, followed by
the URL in parentheses. (Optionally, the URL can be followed by a link
title, in quotes.)

\begin{verbatim}
This is an [inline link](/url), and here's [one with
a title](http://fsf.org "click here for a good time!").
\end{verbatim}

There can be no space between the bracketed part and the parenthesized
part. The link text can contain formatting (such as emphasis), but the
title cannot.

Email addresses in inline links are not autodetected, so they have to be
prefixed with \texttt{mailto}:

\begin{verbatim}
[Write me!](mailto:sam@green.eggs.ham)
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{reference-links}{%
\subsubsection{Reference links}\label{reference-links}}

An \emph{explicit} reference link has two parts, the link itself and the
link definition, which may occur elsewhere in the document (either
before or after the link).

The link consists of link text in square brackets, followed by a label
in square brackets. (There cannot be space between the two unless the
\texttt{spaced\_reference\_links} extension is enabled.) The link
definition consists of the bracketed label, followed by a colon and a
space, followed by the URL, and optionally (after a space) a link title
either in quotes or in parentheses. The label must not be parseable as a
citation (assuming the \texttt{citations} extension is enabled):
citations take precedence over link labels.

Here are some examples:

\begin{verbatim}
[my label 1]: /foo/bar.html  "My title, optional"
[my label 2]: /foo
[my label 3]: http://fsf.org (The free software foundation)
[my label 4]: /bar#special  'A title in single quotes'
\end{verbatim}

The URL may optionally be surrounded by angle brackets:

\begin{verbatim}
[my label 5]: <http://foo.bar.baz>
\end{verbatim}

The title may go on the next line:

\begin{verbatim}
[my label 3]: http://fsf.org
  "The free software foundation"
\end{verbatim}

Note that link labels are not case sensitive. So, this will work:

\begin{verbatim}
Here is [my link][FOO]

[Foo]: /bar/baz
\end{verbatim}

In an \emph{implicit} reference link, the second pair of brackets is
empty:

\begin{verbatim}
See [my website][].

[my website]: http://foo.bar.baz
\end{verbatim}

Note: In \texttt{Markdown.pl} and most other Markdown implementations,
reference link definitions cannot occur in nested constructions such as
list items or block quotes. Pandoc lifts this arbitrary seeming
restriction. So the following is fine in pandoc, though not in most
other implementations:

\begin{verbatim}
> My block [quote].
>
> [quote]: /foo
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-shortcut_reference_links}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{shortcut\_reference\_links}}{Extension: shortcut\_reference\_links}}\label{extension-shortcut_reference_links}}

In a \emph{shortcut} reference link, the second pair of brackets may be
omitted entirely:

\begin{verbatim}
See [my website].

[my website]: http://foo.bar.baz
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{internal-links}{%
\subsubsection{Internal links}\label{internal-links}}

To link to another section of the same document, use the automatically
generated identifier (see \protect\hyperlink{header-identifiers}{Header
identifiers}). For example:

\begin{verbatim}
See the [Introduction](#introduction).
\end{verbatim}

or

\begin{verbatim}
See the [Introduction].

[Introduction]: #introduction
\end{verbatim}

Internal links are currently supported for HTML formats (including HTML
slide shows and EPUB), LaTeX, and ConTeXt.

\hypertarget{images}{%
\subsection{Images}\label{images}}

A link immediately preceded by a \texttt{!} will be treated as an image.
The link text will be used as the image's alt text:

\begin{verbatim}
![la lune](lalune.jpg "Voyage to the moon")

![movie reel]

[movie reel]: movie.gif
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-implicit_figures}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{implicit\_figures}}{Extension: implicit\_figures}}\label{extension-implicit_figures}}

An image with nonempty alt text, occurring by itself in a paragraph,
will be rendered as a figure with a caption. The image's alt text will
be used as the caption.

\begin{verbatim}
![This is the caption](/url/of/image.png)
\end{verbatim}

How this is rendered depends on the output format. Some output formats
(e.g.~RTF) do not yet support figures. In those formats, you'll just get
an image in a paragraph by itself, with no caption.

If you just want a regular inline image, just make sure it is not the
only thing in the paragraph. One way to do this is to insert a
nonbreaking space after the image:

\begin{verbatim}
![This image won't be a figure](/url/of/image.png)\
\end{verbatim}

Note that in reveal.js slide shows, an image in a paragraph by itself
that has the \texttt{stretch} class will fill the screen, and the
caption and figure tags will be omitted.

\hypertarget{extension-link_attributes}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{link\_attributes}}{Extension: link\_attributes}}\label{extension-link_attributes}}

Attributes can be set on links and images:

\begin{verbatim}
An inline ![image](foo.jpg){#id .class width=30 height=20px}
and a reference ![image][ref] with attributes.

[ref]: foo.jpg "optional title" {#id .class key=val key2="val 2"}
\end{verbatim}

(This syntax is compatible with
\href{https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/}{PHP Markdown
Extra} when only \texttt{\#id} and \texttt{.class} are used.)

For HTML and EPUB, all attributes except \texttt{width} and
\texttt{height} (but including \texttt{srcset} and \texttt{sizes}) are
passed through as is. The other writers ignore attributes that are not
supported by their output format.

The \texttt{width} and \texttt{height} attributes on images are treated
specially. When used without a unit, the unit is assumed to be pixels.
However, any of the following unit identifiers can be used: \texttt{px},
\texttt{cm}, \texttt{mm}, \texttt{in}, \texttt{inch} and \texttt{\%}.
There must not be any spaces between the number and the unit. For
example:

\begin{verbatim}
![](file.jpg){ width=50% }
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dimensions are converted to inches for output in page-based formats
  like LaTeX. Dimensions are converted to pixels for output in HTML-like
  formats. Use the \texttt{-\/-dpi} option to specify the number of
  pixels per inch. The default is 96dpi.
\item
  The \texttt{\%} unit is generally relative to some available space.
  For example the above example will render to
  \texttt{\textless{}img\ href="file.jpg"\ style="width:\ 50\%;"\ /\textgreater{}}
  (HTML),
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}includegraphics{[}width=0.5\textbackslash{}textwidth{]}\{file.jpg\}}
  (LaTeX), or
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}externalfigure{[}file.jpg{]}{[}width=0.5\textbackslash{}textwidth{]}}
  (ConTeXt).
\item
  Some output formats have a notion of a class
  (\href{http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Using_Graphics\#Multiple_Image_Settings}{ConTeXt})
  or a unique identifier (LaTeX \texttt{\textbackslash{}caption}), or
  both (HTML).
\item
  When no \texttt{width} or \texttt{height} attributes are specified,
  the fallback is to look at the image resolution and the dpi metadata
  embedded in the image file.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{divs-and-spans}{%
\subsection{Divs and Spans}\label{divs-and-spans}}

Using the \texttt{native\_divs} and \texttt{native\_spans} extensions
(see \protect\hyperlink{extension-native_divs}{above}), HTML syntax can
be used as part of markdown to create native \texttt{Div} and
\texttt{Span} elements in the pandoc AST (as opposed to raw HTML).
However, there is also nicer syntax available:

\hypertarget{extension-fenced_divs}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{fenced\_divs}}{Extension: fenced\_divs}}\label{extension-fenced_divs}}

Allow special fenced syntax for native \texttt{Div} blocks. A Div starts
with a fence containing at least three consecutive colons plus some
attributes. The attributes may optionally be followed by another string
of consecutive colons. The attribute syntax is exactly as in fenced code
blocks (see
\protect\hyperlink{extension-fenced_code_attributes}{Extension:
\texttt{fenced\_code\_attributes}}). As with fenced code blocks, one can
use either attributes in curly braces or a single unbraced word, which
will be treated as a class name. The Div ends with another line
containing a string of at least three consecutive colons. The fenced Div
should be separated by blank lines from preceding and following blocks.

Example:

\begin{verbatim}
::::: {#special .sidebar}
Here is a paragraph.

And another.
:::::
\end{verbatim}

Fenced divs can be nested. Opening fences are distinguished because they
\emph{must} have attributes:

\begin{verbatim}
::: Warning ::::::
This is a warning.

::: Danger
This is a warning within a warning.
:::
::::::::::::::::::
\end{verbatim}

Fences without attributes are always closing fences. Unlike with fenced
code blocks, the number of colons in the closing fence need not match
the number in the opening fence. However, it can be helpful for visual
clarity to use fences of different lengths to distinguish nested divs
from their parents.

\hypertarget{extension-bracketed_spans}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{bracketed\_spans}}{Extension: bracketed\_spans}}\label{extension-bracketed_spans}}

A bracketed sequence of inlines, as one would use to begin a link, will
be treated as a \texttt{Span} with attributes if it is followed
immediately by attributes:

\begin{verbatim}
[This is *some text*]{.class key="val"}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{footnotes}{%
\subsection{Footnotes}\label{footnotes}}

\hypertarget{extension-footnotes}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{footnotes}}{Extension: footnotes}}\label{extension-footnotes}}

Pandoc's Markdown allows footnotes, using the following syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
\end{verbatim}

The identifiers in footnote references may not contain spaces, tabs, or
newlines. These identifiers are used only to correlate the footnote
reference with the note itself; in the output, footnotes will be
numbered sequentially.

The footnotes themselves need not be placed at the end of the document.
They may appear anywhere except inside other block elements (lists,
block quotes, tables, etc.). Each footnote should be separated from
surrounding content (including other footnotes) by blank lines.

\hypertarget{extension-inline_notes}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{inline\_notes}}{Extension: inline\_notes}}\label{extension-inline_notes}}

Inline footnotes are also allowed (though, unlike regular notes, they
cannot contain multiple paragraphs). The syntax is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]
\end{verbatim}

Inline and regular footnotes may be mixed freely.

\hypertarget{extension-citations}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{citations}}{Extension: citations}}\label{extension-citations}}

Using an external filter, \texttt{pandoc-citeproc}, pandoc can
automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of
styles. Basic usage is

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc --filter pandoc-citeproc myinput.txt
\end{verbatim}

In order to use this feature, you will need to specify a bibliography
file using the \texttt{bibliography} metadata field in a YAML metadata
section, or \texttt{-\/-bibliography} command line argument. You can
supply multiple \texttt{-\/-bibliography} arguments or set
\texttt{bibliography} metadata field to YAML array, if you want to use
multiple bibliography files. The bibliography may have any of these
formats:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Format & File extension\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
BibLaTeX & .bib\tabularnewline
BibTeX & .bibtex\tabularnewline
Copac & .copac\tabularnewline
CSL JSON & .json\tabularnewline
CSL YAML & .yaml\tabularnewline
EndNote & .enl\tabularnewline
EndNote XML & .xml\tabularnewline
ISI & .wos\tabularnewline
MEDLINE & .medline\tabularnewline
MODS & .mods\tabularnewline
RIS & .ris\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Note that \texttt{.bib} can be used with both BibTeX and BibLaTeX files;
use \texttt{.bibtex} to force BibTeX.

Note that \texttt{pandoc-citeproc\ -\/-bib2json} and
\texttt{pandoc-citeproc\ -\/-bib2yaml} can produce \texttt{.json} and
\texttt{.yaml} files from any of the supported formats.

In-field markup: In BibTeX and BibLaTeX databases, pandoc-citeproc
parses a subset of LaTeX markup; in CSL YAML databases, pandoc Markdown;
and in CSL JSON databases, an
\href{http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/1.0/release-notes.html\#rich-text-markup-within-fields}{HTML-like
markup}:

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[\texttt{\textless{}i\textgreater{}...\textless{}/i\textgreater{}}]
italics
\item[\texttt{\textless{}b\textgreater{}...\textless{}/b\textgreater{}}]
bold
\item[\texttt{\textless{}span\ style="font-variant:small-caps;"\textgreater{}...\textless{}/span\textgreater{}}
or \texttt{\textless{}sc\textgreater{}...\textless{}/sc\textgreater{}}]
small capitals
\item[\texttt{\textless{}sub\textgreater{}...\textless{}/sub\textgreater{}}]
subscript
\item[\texttt{\textless{}sup\textgreater{}...\textless{}/sup\textgreater{}}]
superscript
\item[\texttt{\textless{}span\ class="nocase"\textgreater{}...\textless{}/span\textgreater{}}]
prevent a phrase from being capitalized as title case
\end{description}

\texttt{pandoc-citeproc\ -j} and \texttt{-y} interconvert the CSL JSON
and CSL YAML formats as far as possible.

As an alternative to specifying a bibliography file using
\texttt{-\/-bibliography} or the YAML metadata field
\texttt{bibliography}, you can include the citation data directly in the
\texttt{references} field of the document's YAML metadata. The field
should contain an array of YAML-encoded references, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
---
references:
- type: article-journal
  id: WatsonCrick1953
  author:
  - family: Watson
    given: J. D.
  - family: Crick
    given: F. H. C.
  issued:
    date-parts:
    - - 1953
      - 4
      - 25
  title: 'Molecular structure of nucleic acids: a structure for deoxyribose
    nucleic acid'
  title-short: Molecular structure of nucleic acids
  container-title: Nature
  volume: 171
  issue: 4356
  page: 737-738
  DOI: 10.1038/171737a0
  URL: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v171/n4356/abs/171737a0.html
  language: en-GB
...
\end{verbatim}

(\texttt{pandoc-citeproc\ -\/-bib2yaml} can produce these from a
bibliography file in one of the supported formats.)

Citations and references can be formatted using any style supported by
the \href{http://citationstyles.org}{Citation Style Language}, listed in
the \href{https://www.zotero.org/styles}{Zotero Style Repository}. These
files are specified using the \texttt{-\/-csl} option or the
\texttt{csl} metadata field. By default, \texttt{pandoc-citeproc} will
use the \href{http://chicagomanualofstyle.org}{Chicago Manual of Style}
author-date format. The CSL project provides further information on
\href{http://citationstyles.org/styles/}{finding and editing styles}.

To make your citations hyperlinks to the corresponding bibliography
entries, add \texttt{link-citations:\ true} to your YAML metadata.

Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons.
Each citation must have a key, composed of `@' + the citation identifier
from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a
suffix. The citation key must begin with a letter, digit, or
\texttt{\_}, and may contain alphanumerics, \texttt{\_}, and internal
punctuation characters
(\texttt{:.\#\$\%\&-+?\textless{}\textgreater{}\textasciitilde{}/}).
Here are some examples:

\begin{verbatim}
Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, chap. 1].

Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{pandoc-citeproc} detects locator terms in the
\href{https://github.com/citation-style-language/locales}{CSL locale
files}. Either abbreviated or unabbreviated forms are accepted. In the
\texttt{en-US} locale, locator terms can be written in either singular
or plural forms, as \texttt{book}, \texttt{bk.}/\texttt{bks.};
\texttt{chapter}, \texttt{chap.}/\texttt{chaps.}; \texttt{column},
\texttt{col.}/\texttt{cols.}; \texttt{figure},
\texttt{fig.}/\texttt{figs.}; \texttt{folio},
\texttt{fol.}/\texttt{fols.}; \texttt{number},
\texttt{no.}/\texttt{nos.}; \texttt{line}, \texttt{l.}/\texttt{ll.};
\texttt{note}, \texttt{n.}/\texttt{nn.}; \texttt{opus},
\texttt{op.}/\texttt{opp.}; \texttt{page}, \texttt{p.}/\texttt{pp.};
\texttt{paragraph}, \texttt{para.}/\texttt{paras.}; \texttt{part},
\texttt{pt.}/\texttt{pts.}; \texttt{section},
\texttt{sec.}/\texttt{secs.}; \texttt{sub\ verbo},
\texttt{s.v.}/\texttt{s.vv.}; \texttt{verse}, \texttt{v.}/\texttt{vv.};
\texttt{volume}, \texttt{vol.}/\texttt{vols.}; \texttt{Â¶}/\texttt{Â¶Â¶};
\texttt{Â§}/\texttt{Â§Â§}. If no locator term is used, ``page'' is assumed.

A minus sign (\texttt{-}) before the \texttt{@} will suppress mention of
the author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is
already mentioned in the text:

\begin{verbatim}
Smith says blah [-@smith04].
\end{verbatim}

You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
@smith04 says blah.

@smith04 [p. 33] says blah.
\end{verbatim}

If the style calls for a list of works cited, it will be placed at the
end of the document. Normally, you will want to end your document with
an appropriate header:

\begin{verbatim}
last paragraph...

# References
\end{verbatim}

The bibliography will be inserted after this header. Note that the
\texttt{unnumbered} class will be added to this header, so that the
section will not be numbered.

If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing
them in the body text, you can define a dummy \texttt{nocite} metadata
field and put the citations there:

\begin{verbatim}
---
nocite: |
  @item1, @item2
...

@item3
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the document will contain a citation for \texttt{item3}
only, but the bibliography will contain entries for \texttt{item1},
\texttt{item2}, and \texttt{item3}.

It is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether
or not they appear in the document, by using a wildcard:

\begin{verbatim}
---
nocite: |
  @*
...
\end{verbatim}

For LaTeX or PDF output, you can also use
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib}{\texttt{natbib}} or
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex}{\texttt{biblatex}} to render
bibliography. In order to do so, specify bibliography files as outlined
above, and add \texttt{-\/-natbib} or \texttt{-\/-biblatex} argument to
\texttt{pandoc} invocation. Bear in mind that bibliography files have to
be in respective format (either BibTeX or BibLaTeX).

For more information, see the
\href{https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc/blob/master/man/pandoc-citeproc.1.md}{pandoc-citeproc
man page}.

\hypertarget{non-pandoc-extensions}{%
\subsection{Non-pandoc extensions}\label{non-pandoc-extensions}}

The following Markdown syntax extensions are not enabled by default in
pandoc, but may be enabled by adding \texttt{+EXTENSION} to the format
name, where \texttt{EXTENSION} is the name of the extension. Thus, for
example, \texttt{markdown+hard\_line\_breaks} is Markdown with hard line
breaks.

\hypertarget{extension-old_dashes}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{old\_dashes}}{Extension: old\_dashes}}\label{extension-old_dashes}}

Selects the pandoc \textless{}= 1.8.2.1 behavior for parsing smart
dashes: \texttt{-} before a numeral is an en-dash, and \texttt{-\/-} is
an em-dash. This option only has an effect if \texttt{smart} is enabled.
It is selected automatically for \texttt{textile} input.

\hypertarget{extension-angle_brackets_escapable}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{angle\_brackets\_escapable}}{Extension: angle\_brackets\_escapable}}\label{extension-angle_brackets_escapable}}

Allow \texttt{\textless{}} and \texttt{\textgreater{}} to be
backslash-escaped, as they can be in GitHub flavored Markdown but not
original Markdown. This is implied by pandoc's default
\texttt{all\_symbols\_escapable}.

\hypertarget{extension-lists_without_preceding_blankline}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{lists\_without\_preceding\_blankline}}{Extension: lists\_without\_preceding\_blankline}}\label{extension-lists_without_preceding_blankline}}

Allow a list to occur right after a paragraph, with no intervening blank
space.

\hypertarget{extension-four_space_rule}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{four\_space\_rule}}{Extension: four\_space\_rule}}\label{extension-four_space_rule}}

Selects the pandoc \textless{}= 2.0 behavior for parsing lists, so that
four spaces indent are needed for list item continuation paragraphs.

\hypertarget{extension-spaced_reference_links}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{spaced\_reference\_links}}{Extension: spaced\_reference\_links}}\label{extension-spaced_reference_links}}

Allow whitespace between the two components of a reference link, for
example,

\begin{verbatim}
[foo] [bar].
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-hard_line_breaks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{hard\_line\_breaks}}{Extension: hard\_line\_breaks}}\label{extension-hard_line_breaks}}

Causes all newlines within a paragraph to be interpreted as hard line
breaks instead of spaces.

\hypertarget{extension-ignore_line_breaks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{ignore\_line\_breaks}}{Extension: ignore\_line\_breaks}}\label{extension-ignore_line_breaks}}

Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being
treated as spaces or as hard line breaks. This option is intended for
use with East Asian languages where spaces are not used between words,
but text is divided into lines for readability.

\hypertarget{extension-east_asian_line_breaks}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{east\_asian\_line\_breaks}}{Extension: east\_asian\_line\_breaks}}\label{extension-east_asian_line_breaks}}

Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being
treated as spaces or as hard line breaks, when they occur between two
East Asian wide characters. This is a better choice than
\texttt{ignore\_line\_breaks} for texts that include a mix of East Asian
wide characters and other characters.

\hypertarget{extension-emoji}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{emoji}}{Extension: emoji}}\label{extension-emoji}}

Parses textual emojis like \texttt{:smile:} as Unicode emoticons.

\hypertarget{extension-tex_math_single_backslash}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{tex\_math\_single\_backslash}}{Extension: tex\_math\_single\_backslash}}\label{extension-tex_math_single_backslash}}

Causes anything between \texttt{\textbackslash{}(} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{})} to be interpreted as inline TeX math, and
anything between \texttt{\textbackslash{}{[}} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}{]}} to be interpreted as display TeX math.
Note: a drawback of this extension is that it precludes escaping
\texttt{(} and \texttt{{[}}.

\hypertarget{extension-tex_math_double_backslash}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{tex\_math\_double\_backslash}}{Extension: tex\_math\_double\_backslash}}\label{extension-tex_math_double_backslash}}

Causes anything between \texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}(} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{})} to be interpreted as inline
TeX math, and anything between
\texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}{[}} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}{]}} to be interpreted as
display TeX math.

\hypertarget{extension-markdown_attribute}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{markdown\_attribute}}{Extension: markdown\_attribute}}\label{extension-markdown_attribute}}

By default, pandoc interprets material inside block-level tags as
Markdown. This extension changes the behavior so that Markdown is only
parsed inside block-level tags if the tags have the attribute
\texttt{markdown=1}.

\hypertarget{extension-mmd_title_block}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{mmd\_title\_block}}{Extension: mmd\_title\_block}}\label{extension-mmd_title_block}}

Enables a \href{http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/}{MultiMarkdown}
style title block at the top of the document, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
Title:   My title
Author:  John Doe
Date:    September 1, 2008
Comment: This is a sample mmd title block, with
         a field spanning multiple lines.
\end{verbatim}

See the MultiMarkdown documentation for details. If
\texttt{pandoc\_title\_block} or \texttt{yaml\_metadata\_block} is
enabled, it will take precedence over \texttt{mmd\_title\_block}.

\hypertarget{extension-abbreviations}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{abbreviations}}{Extension: abbreviations}}\label{extension-abbreviations}}

Parses PHP Markdown Extra abbreviation keys, like

\begin{verbatim}
*[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language
\end{verbatim}

Note that the pandoc document model does not support abbreviations, so
if this extension is enabled, abbreviation keys are simply skipped (as
opposed to being parsed as paragraphs).

\hypertarget{extension-autolink_bare_uris}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{autolink\_bare\_uris}}{Extension: autolink\_bare\_uris}}\label{extension-autolink_bare_uris}}

Makes all absolute URIs into links, even when not surrounded by pointy
braces \texttt{\textless{}...\textgreater{}}.

\hypertarget{extension-mmd_link_attributes}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{mmd\_link\_attributes}}{Extension: mmd\_link\_attributes}}\label{extension-mmd_link_attributes}}

Parses multimarkdown style key-value attributes on link and image
references. This extension should not be confused with the
\protect\hyperlink{extension-link_attributes}{\texttt{link\_attributes}}
extension.

\begin{verbatim}
This is a reference ![image][ref] with multimarkdown attributes.

[ref]: http://path.to/image "Image title" width=20px height=30px
       id=myId class="myClass1 myClass2"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{extension-mmd_header_identifiers}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{mmd\_header\_identifiers}}{Extension: mmd\_header\_identifiers}}\label{extension-mmd_header_identifiers}}

Parses multimarkdown style header identifiers (in square brackets, after
the header but before any trailing \texttt{\#}s in an ATX header).

\hypertarget{extension-compact_definition_lists}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Extension:
\texttt{compact\_definition\_lists}}{Extension: compact\_definition\_lists}}\label{extension-compact_definition_lists}}

Activates the definition list syntax of pandoc 1.12.x and earlier. This
syntax differs from the one described above under
\protect\hyperlink{definition-lists}{Definition lists} in several
respects:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No blank line is required between consecutive items of the definition
  list.
\item
  To get a ``tight'' or ``compact'' list, omit space between consecutive
  items; the space between a term and its definition does not affect
  anything.
\item
  Lazy wrapping of paragraphs is not allowed: the entire definition must
  be indented four spaces.\footnote{To see why laziness is incompatible
    with relaxing the requirement of a blank line between items,
    consider the following example:

\begin{Verbatim}
bar
:    definition
foo
:    definition
\end{Verbatim}

    Is this a single list item with two definitions of ``bar,'' the
    first of which is lazily wrapped, or two list items? To remove the
    ambiguity we must either disallow lazy wrapping or require a blank
    line between list items.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{markdown-variants}{%
\subsection{Markdown variants}\label{markdown-variants}}

In addition to pandoc's extended Markdown, the following Markdown
variants are supported:

\begin{description}
\tightlist

\texttt{footnotes}, \texttt{pipe\_tables}, \texttt{raw\_html},
\texttt{markdown\_attribute}, \texttt{fenced\_code\_blocks},

\texttt{raw\_attribute}.
\item[\texttt{markdown\_strict} (Markdown.pl)]
\texttt{raw\_html}, \texttt{shortcut\_reference\_links},

\end{description}

We also support \texttt{commonmark} and \texttt{gfm} (GitHub-Flavored
Markdown, which is implemented as a set of extensions on
\texttt{commonmark}).

Note, however, that \texttt{commonmark} and \texttt{gfm} have limited
support for extensions. Only those listed below (and \texttt{smart} and
\texttt{raw\_tex}) will work. The extensions can, however, all be
individually disabled. Also, \texttt{raw\_tex} only affects \texttt{gfm}
output, not input.

\hypertarget{producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc}{%
\section{Producing slide shows with
pandoc}\label{producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc}}

You can use pandoc to produce an HTML + JavaScript slide presentation
that can be viewed via a web browser. There are five ways to do this,
using \href{http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/}{S5},
\href{http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/}{DZSlides},
\href{http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/}{Slidy},
\href{http://goessner.net/articles/slideous/}{Slideous}, or
\href{http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/}{reveal.js}. You can also produce a
PDF slide show using LaTeX
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer}{\texttt{beamer}}, or slides shows in
Microsoft
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint}{PowerPoint}
format.

Here's the Markdown source for a simple slide show, \texttt{habits.txt}:

\begin{verbatim}
% Habits
% John Doe
% March 22, 2005

# In the morning

## Getting up

- Turn off alarm
- Get out of bed

## Breakfast

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee

# In the evening

## Dinner

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine

------------------

![picture of spaghetti](images/spaghetti.jpg)

## Going to sleep

- Get in bed
- Count sheep
\end{verbatim}

To produce an HTML/JavaScript slide show, simply type

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -t FORMAT -s habits.txt -o habits.html
\end{verbatim}

where \texttt{FORMAT} is either \texttt{s5}, \texttt{slidy},
\texttt{slideous}, \texttt{dzslides}, or \texttt{revealjs}.

For Slidy, Slideous, reveal.js, and S5, the file produced by pandoc with
the \texttt{-s/-\/-standalone} option embeds a link to JavaScript and
CSS files, which are assumed to be available at the relative path
\texttt{s5/default} (for S5), \texttt{slideous} (for Slideous),
\texttt{reveal.js} (for reveal.js), or at the Slidy website at
\texttt{w3.org} (for Slidy). (These paths can be changed by setting the
\texttt{slidy-url}, \texttt{slideous-url}, \texttt{revealjs-url}, or
\texttt{s5-url} variables; see
\protect\hyperlink{variables-for-slides}{Variables for slides}, above.)
For DZSlides, the (relatively short) JavaScript and CSS are included in
the file by default.

With all HTML slide formats, the \texttt{-\/-self-contained} option can
be used to produce a single file that contains all of the data necessary
to display the slide show, including linked scripts, stylesheets,
images, and videos.

To produce a PDF slide show using beamer, type

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -t beamer habits.txt -o habits.pdf
\end{verbatim}

Note that a reveal.js slide show can also be converted to a PDF by
printing it to a file from the browser.

To produce a Powerpoint slide show, type

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc habits.txt -o habits.pptx
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{structuring-the-slide-show}{%
\subsection{Structuring the slide
show}\label{structuring-the-slide-show}}

By default, the \emph{slide level} is the highest header level in the
hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another
header, somewhere in the document. In the example above, level 1 headers
are always followed by level 2 headers, which are followed by content,
so 2 is the slide level. This default can be overridden using the
\texttt{-\/-slide-level} option.

The document is carved up into slides according to the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A horizontal rule always starts a new slide.
\item
  A header at the slide level always starts a new slide.
\item
  Headers \emph{below} the slide level in the hierarchy create headers
  \emph{within} a slide.
\item
  Headers \emph{above} the slide level in the hierarchy create ``title
  slides,'' which just contain the section title and help to break the
  slide show into sections.
\item
  Content \emph{above} the slide level will not appear in the slide
  show.
\item
  A title page is constructed automatically from the document's title
  block, if present. (In the case of beamer, this can be disabled by
  commenting out some lines in the default template.)
\end{itemize}

These rules are designed to support many different styles of slide show.
If you don't care about structuring your slides into sections and
subsections, you can just use level 1 headers for all each slide. (In
that case, level 1 will be the slide level.) But you can also structure
the slide show into sections, as in the example above.

Note: in reveal.js slide shows, if slide level is 2, a two-dimensional
layout will be produced, with level 1 headers building horizontally and
level 2 headers building vertically. It is not recommended that you use
deeper nesting of section levels with reveal.js.

\hypertarget{incremental-lists}{%
\subsection{Incremental lists}\label{incremental-lists}}

By default, these writers produce lists that display ``all at once.'' If
you want your lists to display incrementally (one item at a time), use
the \texttt{-i} option. If you want a particular list to depart from the
default, put it in a \texttt{div} block with class \texttt{incremental}
or \texttt{nonincremental}. So, for example, using the
\texttt{fenced\ div} syntax, the following would be incremental
regardless of the document default:

\begin{verbatim}
::: incremental

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine

:::
\end{verbatim}

or

\begin{verbatim}
::: nonincremental

- Eat spaghetti
- Drink wine

:::
\end{verbatim}

While using \texttt{incremental} and \texttt{nonincremental} divs are
the recommended method of setting incremental lists on a per-case basis,
an older method is also supported: putting lists inside a blockquote
will depart from the document default (that is, it will display
incrementally without the \texttt{-i} option and all at once with the
\texttt{-i} option):

\begin{verbatim}
> - Eat spaghetti
> - Drink wine
\end{verbatim}

Both methods allow incremental and nonincremental lists to be mixed in a
single document.

\hypertarget{inserting-pauses}{%
\subsection{Inserting pauses}\label{inserting-pauses}}

You can add ``pauses'' within a slide by including a paragraph
containing three dots, separated by spaces:

\begin{verbatim}
# Slide with a pause

content before the pause

. . .

content after the pause
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{styling-the-slides}{%
\subsection{Styling the slides}\label{styling-the-slides}}

You can change the style of HTML slides by putting customized CSS files
in \texttt{\$DATADIR/s5/default} (for S5), \texttt{\$DATADIR/slidy} (for
Slidy), or \texttt{\$DATADIR/slideous} (for Slideous), where
\texttt{\$DATADIR} is the user data directory (see
\texttt{-\/-data-dir}, above). The originals may be found in pandoc's
system data directory (generally
\texttt{\$CABALDIR/pandoc-VERSION/s5/default}). Pandoc will look there
for any files it does not find in the user data directory.

For dzslides, the CSS is included in the HTML file itself, and may be
modified there.

All \href{https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js\#configuration}{reveal.js
configuration options} can be set through variables. For example, themes
can be used by setting the \texttt{theme} variable:

\begin{verbatim}
-V theme=moon
\end{verbatim}

Or you can specify a custom stylesheet using the \texttt{-\/-css}
option.

To style beamer slides, you can specify a \texttt{theme},
\texttt{colortheme}, \texttt{fonttheme}, \texttt{innertheme}, and
\texttt{outertheme}, using the \texttt{-V} option:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -t beamer habits.txt -V theme:Warsaw -o habits.pdf
\end{verbatim}

Note that header attributes will turn into slide attributes (on a
\texttt{\textless{}div\textgreater{}} or
\texttt{\textless{}section\textgreater{}}) in HTML slide formats,
allowing you to style individual slides. In beamer, the only header
attribute that affects slides is the \texttt{allowframebreaks} class,
which sets the \texttt{allowframebreaks} option, causing multiple slides
to be created if the content overfills the frame. This is recommended
especially for bibliographies:

\begin{verbatim}
# References {.allowframebreaks}
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{speaker-notes}{%
\subsection{Speaker notes}\label{speaker-notes}}

Speaker notes are supported in reveal.js and PowerPoint (pptx) output.
You can add notes to your Markdown document thus:

\begin{verbatim}
::: notes

This is my note.

- It can contain Markdown
- like this list

:::
\end{verbatim}

To show the notes window in reveal.js, press \texttt{s} while viewing
the presentation. Speaker notes in PowerPoint will be available, as
usual, in handouts and presenter view.

Notes are not yet supported for other slide formats, but the notes will
not appear on the slides themselves.

\hypertarget{columns}{%
\subsection{Columns}\label{columns}}

To put material in side by side columns, you can use a native div
container with class \texttt{columns}, containing two or more div
containers with class \texttt{column} and a \texttt{width} attribute:

\begin{verbatim}
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
contents...
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
contents...
:::
::::::::::::::
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{frame-attributes-in-beamer}{%
\subsection{Frame attributes in
beamer}\label{frame-attributes-in-beamer}}

Sometimes it is necessary to add the LaTeX \texttt{{[}fragile{]}} option
to a frame in beamer (for example, when using the \texttt{minted}
environment). This can be forced by adding the \texttt{fragile} class to
the header introducing the slide:

\begin{verbatim}
# Fragile slide {.fragile}
\end{verbatim}

All of the other frame attributes described in Section 8.1 of the
\href{http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf}{Beamer
User's Guide} may also be used: \texttt{allowdisplaybreaks},
\texttt{allowframebreaks}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}, \texttt{t},
\texttt{environment}, \texttt{label}, \texttt{plain}, \texttt{shrink}.

\hypertarget{background-in-reveal.js}{%
\subsection{Background in reveal.js}\label{background-in-reveal.js}}

Background images can be added to self-contained reveal.js slideshows.

For the same image on every slide, use the reveal.js configuration
option \texttt{parallaxBackgroundImage} either in the YAML metadata
block or as a command-line variable. You can also set
\texttt{parallaxBackgroundHorizontal} and
\texttt{parallaxBackgroundVertical} the same way and must also set
\texttt{parallaxBackgroundSize} to have your values take effect.

To set an image for a particular slide, add
\texttt{\{data-background-image="/path/to/image"\}} to the first
slide-level header on the slide (which may even be empty).

In reveal.js's overview mode, the parallaxBackgroundImage will show up
only on the first slide.

Other background settings also work on individual slides, including
\texttt{data-background-size}, \texttt{data-background-repeat},
\texttt{data-background-color}, \texttt{data-transition}, and
\texttt{data-transition-speed}.

See the
\href{https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js\#slide-backgrounds}{reveal.js
documentation} for more details.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
---
title: My Slideshow
parallaxBackgroundImage: /path/to/my/background_image.png
---

## Slide One

Slide 1 has background_image.png as its background.

## {data-background-image="/path/to/special_image.jpg"}

Slide 2 has a special image for its background, even though the header has no content.
\end{verbatim}

\section{Creating EPUBs with pandoc}\label{creating-epubs-with-pandoc}}

\hypertarget{epub-metadata}{%
\subsection{EPUB Metadata}\label{epub-metadata}}

EPUB metadata may be specified using the \texttt{-\/-epub-metadata}
option, but if the source document is Markdown, it is better to use a
\protect\hyperlink{extension-yaml_metadata_block}{YAML metadata block}.
Here is an example:

\begin{verbatim}
---
title:
- type: main
  text: My Book
- type: subtitle
  text: An investigation of metadata
creator:
- role: author
  text: John Smith
- role: editor
  text: Sarah Jones
identifier:
- scheme: DOI
  text: doi:10.234234.234/33
publisher:  My Press
rights: Â© 2007 John Smith, CC BY-NC
ibooks:
  version: 1.3.4
...
\end{verbatim}

The following fields are recognized:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{identifier}]
Either a string value or an object with fields \texttt{text} and
\texttt{scheme}. Valid values for \texttt{scheme} are \texttt{ISBN-10},
\texttt{GTIN-13}, \texttt{UPC}, \texttt{ISMN-10}, \texttt{DOI},
\texttt{LCCN}, \texttt{GTIN-14}, \texttt{ISBN-13},
\texttt{Legal\ deposit\ number}, \texttt{URN}, \texttt{OCLC},
\texttt{ISMN-13}, \texttt{ISBN-A}, \texttt{JP}, \texttt{OLCC}.
\item[\texttt{title}]
Either a string value, or an object with fields \texttt{file-as} and
\texttt{type}, or a list of such objects. Valid values for \texttt{type}
are \texttt{main}, \texttt{subtitle}, \texttt{short},
\texttt{collection}, \texttt{edition}, \texttt{extended}.
\item[\texttt{creator}]
Either a string value, or an object with fields \texttt{role},
\texttt{file-as}, and \texttt{text}, or a list of such objects. Valid
values for \texttt{role} are
\href{http://loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html}{MARC relators}, but
pandoc will attempt to translate the human-readable versions (like
``author'' and ``editor'') to the appropriate marc relators.
\item[\texttt{contributor}]
Same format as \texttt{creator}.
\item[\texttt{date}]
A string value in \texttt{YYYY-MM-DD} format. (Only the year is
necessary.) Pandoc will attempt to convert other common date formats.
\item[\texttt{lang} (or legacy: \texttt{language})]
A string value in \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47}{BCP 47}

  \texttt{true})
\item
  \texttt{scroll-axis}:
  \texttt{vertical}\textbar{}\texttt{horizontal}\textbar{}\texttt{default}
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\hypertarget{linked-media}{%
\subsection{Linked media}\label{linked-media}}

By default, pandoc will download linked media (including audio and
video) and include it in the EPUB container, yielding a completely
self-contained EPUB. If you want to link to external media resources
instead, use raw HTML in your source and add \texttt{data-external="1"}
to the tag with the \texttt{src} attribute. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
<audio controls="1">
  <source src="http://example.com/music/toccata.mp3"
          data-external="1" type="audio/mpeg">
  </source>
</audio>
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{syntax-highlighting}{%
\section{Syntax highlighting}\label{syntax-highlighting}}

Pandoc will automatically highlight syntax in
\protect\hyperlink{fenced-code-blocks}{fenced code blocks} that are
marked with a language name. The Haskell library
\href{https://github.com/jgm/skylighting}{skylighting} is used for
highlighting, which works in HTML, Docx, Ms, and LaTeX/PDF output. To
see a list of language names that pandoc will recognize, type
\texttt{pandoc\ -\/-list-highlight-languages}.

The color scheme can be selected using the \texttt{-\/-highlight-style}
option. The default color scheme is \texttt{pygments}, which imitates
the default color scheme used by the Python library pygments (though
pygments is not actually used to do the highlighting). To see a list of
highlight styles, type \texttt{pandoc\ -\/-list-highlight-styles}.

To disable highlighting, use the \texttt{-\/-no-highlight} option.

\hypertarget{custom-styles-in-docx}{%
\section{Custom Styles in Docx}\label{custom-styles-in-docx}}

\hypertarget{input}{%
\subsection{Input}\label{input}}

The docx reader, by default, only reads those styles that it can convert
into pandoc elements, either by direct conversion or interpreting the
derivation of the input document's styles.

By enabling the \protect\hyperlink{ext-styles}{\texttt{styles}
extension} in the docx reader (\texttt{-f\ docx+styles}), you can
produce output that maintains the styles of the input document, using
the \texttt{custom-style} class. Paragraph styles are interpreted as
divs, while character styles are interpreted as spans.

For example, using the \texttt{custom-style-reference.docx} file in the
test directory, we have the following different outputs:

Without the \texttt{+styles} extension:

\begin{verbatim}
$ pandoc test/docx/custom-style-reference.docx -f docx -t markdown
This is some text.

This is text with an *emphasized* text style. And this is text with a
**strengthened** text style.

> Here is a styled paragraph that inherits from Block Text.
\end{verbatim}

And with the extension:

\begin{verbatim}
$ pandoc test/docx/custom-style-reference.docx -f docx+styles -t markdown

::: {custom-style="FirstParagraph"}
This is some text.
:::

::: {custom-style="BodyText"}
This is text with an [emphasized]{custom-style="Emphatic"} text style.
And this is text with a [strengthened]{custom-style="Strengthened"}
text style.
:::

::: {custom-style="MyBlockStyle"}
> Here is a styled paragraph that inherits from Block Text.
:::
\end{verbatim}

With these custom styles, you can use your input document as a
reference-doc while creating docx output (see below), and maintain the
same styles in your input and output files.

\hypertarget{output}{%
\subsection{Output}\label{output}}

By default, pandoc's docx output applies a predefined set of styles for
blocks such as paragraphs and block quotes, and uses largely default
formatting (italics, bold) for inlines. This will work for most
purposes, especially alongside a \texttt{reference.docx} file. However,
if you need to apply your own styles to blocks, or match a preexisting
set of styles, pandoc allows you to define custom styles for blocks and
text using \texttt{div}s and \texttt{span}s, respectively.

If you define a \texttt{div} or \texttt{span} with the attribute
\texttt{custom-style}, pandoc will apply your specified style to the
contained elements. So, for example using the \texttt{bracketed\_spans}
syntax,

\begin{verbatim}
[Get out]{custom-style="Emphatically"}, he said.
\end{verbatim}

would produce a docx file with ``Get out'' styled with character style
\texttt{Emphatically}. Similarly, using the \texttt{fenced\_divs}
syntax,

\begin{verbatim}
Dickinson starts the poem simply:

::: {custom-style="Poetry"}
| A Bird came down the Walk---
| He did not know I saw---
:::
\end{verbatim}

would style the two contained lines with the \texttt{Poetry} paragraph
style.

If the styles are not yet in your reference.docx, they will be defined
in the output file as inheriting from normal text. If they are already
defined, pandoc will not alter the definition.

This feature allows for greatest customization in conjunction with
\href{http://pandoc.org/filters.html}{pandoc filters}. If you want all
paragraphs after block quotes to be indented, you can write a filter to
apply the styles necessary. If you want all italics to be transformed to
the \texttt{Emphasis} character style (perhaps to change their color),
you can write a filter which will transform all italicized inlines to
inlines within an \texttt{Emphasis} custom-style \texttt{span}.

\hypertarget{custom-writers}{%
\section{Custom writers}\label{custom-writers}}

Pandoc can be extended with custom writers written in
\href{http://www.lua.org}{lua}. (Pandoc includes a lua interpreter, so
lua need not be installed separately.)

To use a custom writer, simply specify the path to the lua script in
place of the output format. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc -t data/sample.lua
\end{verbatim}

Creating a custom writer requires writing a lua function for each
possible element in a pandoc document. To get a documented example which
you can modify according to your needs, do

\begin{verbatim}
pandoc --print-default-data-file sample.lua
\end{verbatim}
