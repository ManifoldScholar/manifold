        # This class is responsible for transforming the text structure returned
        # by the TOC Inspector. The TOC Inspector extracts the three supported
        # EPUB3 navigation types: table of contents, page list, and landmarks.
        # These navigation nodes typically link to internal EPUB URLs. The role
        # of the TOCStructure Transformer is to recursively crawl through these
        # navigation structures and generate navigation structures based on text
        # section IDs, rather then on internal EPUB source paths.

          # @param [Hash] text_structure The text structure hash is a hash that
          #   has three symbol keys: <tt>:toc</tt>, <tt>:page_list</tt>, <tt>
          #   :landmarks</tt>. The easiest way to get this hash is from
          #   Ingestor::Strategy::EPUB3::Inspector::TOC#text_structure.
          # @param [Text] text A Manifold Text model with text sections already
          #   added. It's important that the ingestor has already ingested
          #   TextSections and added them to the Text model.
