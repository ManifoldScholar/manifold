# Manifold

Manifold is an intuitive, collaborative platform for scholarly publishing. With iterative texts, powerful annotation tools, rich media support, and robust community dialogue, Manifold transforms scholarly publications into living digital works.

## About the Project

The [University of Minnesota Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu) in partnership with the [GC Digital Scholarship Lab](https://gcdsl.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) at the [Graduate Center](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home) of the [City University of New York](http://cuny.edu) has been awarded [a $732,000 grant](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/university-of-minnesota-at-twin-cities/11500644/) from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org) to launch [Manifold Scholarship](http://manifold.umn.edu). The development of Manifold is performed by [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com), a digital development agency in Portland, Oregon.

## Open Development

Our ultimate goal is to build an open source tool that other university presses will use. To that end, we want to hear from our prospective users throughout the design and development process. To participate in the discussion, join us on our [Building Manifold Development Blog](http://manifold.umn.edu). As we proceed with this project, we'll be using a [Pivotal Tracker project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1457560) to plan our sprints.

## Manifold Reader

Manifold API is the client-side component of Manifold. It is currently being actively developed and should be considered pre-alpha. 

Manifold Reader is built using Node, Express, ES6, and React. It is currently in a very early proof of concept stage.
