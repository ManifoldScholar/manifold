            Wuerker draws the corporation as Frankenstein’s creature, depicting
            the act in which the monster’s lifeless body is given human form. It
            is not Doctor Frankenstein coordinating this freakish science
            project but judges and “big corporate lawyers” with gavels and
            briefcases in hand, moving the levers of the “Supreme Court,” an
            apparatus that transforms the people’s power into its opposite: the
            living dead monster, “Globomegacorp.” Meanwhile, “the people”
            uselessly grasp the “Bill of Rights,” as she is strapped in,
            seemingly against her will, to this legal contraption. It is a

            established under the McCain–Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Finance
            Act of 2002. In an expansive ruling that overturned long-standing
            court precedents, the Court held that such limitations on corporate
            “speech” in elections were prohibited. That the ruling hinged on the
            treatment of corporations as legal persons was made evident by newly
            appointed Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s comments during the oral
            presentation of the case. Sotomayor noted that the Court “gave
            birth” to corporations, endowing “a creature of state law with human
            characteristics,” and thus “there could be an argument made that
            that was the court’s error to start with.”

            Indeed, both scholars and activists have looked at the
            constitutional protection of corporate rights as a great boon to
            corporate capitalism, and they have adopted a variety of strategies
            to challenge the conflation of corporate and natural persons within
            the law. Harvard law professor Morton Horwitz provided the academic
            statement of this position in his account of the
            early-twentieth-century development of corporate personhood.
            “Natural entity theories,” he argued, were “a major factor in
            legitimating big business and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. none of the other
            theoretical alternatives [for conceptualizing the legal status of
            corporations] could provide as much sustenance to newly organized,
            concentrated enterprise.”

            and the Alliance for Justice) reiterate elements of this argument,
            voicing concerns that legal personhood helps consolidate corporate
            economic and political power. The IFG has advocated charter reform
            to end corporate personhood as part of its 2002 report on
            alternatives to economic globalization, and Nader has recently
            suggested impeachment of the conservative wing of the Supreme Court

              Inanimate corporations created by state government charters have
              risen as Frankensteins to control the people through one judicial
              activist decision after another. It was the Supreme Court in 1886
              that started treating a corporation as a “person” for purposes of
              the equal protection right in the fourteenth amendment [

              headnotes even though the Court’s opinion did not go that far. But
              then it was off to the races. These inanimate giants, astride the
              globe, have privileges and immunities that “We the People” can
              only dream about, yet they have equal constitutional rights with
              us (except for the right against self-incrimination (Fifth

            proceedings touched off a wide-ranging discussion among legal
            scholars, jurists, politicians, and philosophers, resulting in a
            prodigious outpouring of research and analysis on personhood through
            the turn of the twentieth century.

            Despite these arguments, it remains unclear exactly what it is about
            legal personhood that, when applied to corporations, is so uniquely
            empowering. As we have seen, corporations were considered monsters
            and parasites before they were treated as rights-bearing
            individuals. For those focused on eliminating corporate personhood,
            a primary rationale has been that personhood suggests a political
            commensurability between living persons and corporate entities that
            corporate wealth and resources belie. Admittedly, the
            disproportionate political power of large corporations compared to
            the vast majority of individuals is evident and startling. Yet the
            same could be said of the relations between the richest individuals
            and large swaths of the population. In this sense, the monster
            pillaging democratic politics is the political power of{" "}

            {" "}which the Court confuses with speech. Furthermore, the argument
            that challenging corporate personhood is neither the paramount issue
            in corporate governance nor a particularly effective legal strategy
            has an impressive intellectual pedigree in its own right. John
            Dewey, the progressive educational reformer, philosopher, and public
            intellectual, argued in an important 1926{" "}
          </span>

            <span>Yale Law Journal</span>
          </i>
          <span>
            {" "}article that the conception of the corporation as a person does
            not, by itself, determine the scope of corporate powers. Writing at
            the height of this earlier debate over corporate personality, he
            argued that, as a legal category, “‘person’ signifies what law makes
            it signify.”

          <span>
            {" "}Conceived as either quasi-public entities created by state
            power or legal persons, Dewey suggested that resolving problems with
            the scope of corporate power was a political issue rather than one
            of legal form. Bringing corporations in line with democracy meant
            asserting political control over what corporations do, not what they
            are.

            This chapter suggests that although personhood certainly has shaped
            corporate power, opening legal arguments for corporate interests
            that would not be available otherwise, it is most usefully
            understood as a key to the shifting problematic of liberalism.
            Because corporations were already powerful institutional
            arrangements for governing the complex of individuals and things
            before they were given constitutional protections as persons, it is
            difficult to accept the argument that personhood{" "}

            <span>uniquely</span>

          <span>
            {" "}created and consolidated corporate power. Instead, corporate
            personhood can be better understood as a retroactive attempt to
            rationalize an institution closely connected with early modern
            models of sovereignty and police within the juridical framework of a
            liberal capitalist political economy—a framework that, by the late
            nineteenth century, was coming to hinge on concepts of personhood,
            rights, and citizenship. In doing so, lawyers, judges, and scholars
            created new meanings and definitions of both the corporation and the
            political community that redrew the boundaries of political
            inclusion and exclusion.
