Thank you for taking the time to open this feature request. The Manifold team reviewed this issue during our bi-weekly meeting and the consensus is that this feature makes sense and is in keeping with our overall vision for the platform. That said, we don’t currently have funding available to support development of this feature. We’ve added a “needs funding” label to this feature request and closed it for now. This label signifies that should we find funding for this feature, or if the requestor wants to explore funding development, we’d be open to further discussion. It also means that we’re willing to accept pull requests that implement this feature.
