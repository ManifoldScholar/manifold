## Overview

#### Manifold is Beta Software.
Manifold is still very much in a beta state, and has another year of development ahead of it. More to the point, our documentation is still a work in progress.

#### Manifold is a collaboration, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Mellon Foundation.

The [University of Minnesota Press](https://www.upress.umn.edu) in partnership with the [GC Digital Scholarship Lab](https://gcdsl.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) at the [Graduate Center](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home) of the [City University of New York](http://cuny.edu) has been awarded [a $732,000 grant](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/university-of-minnesota-at-twin-cities/11500644/) from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org) to launch [Manifold Scholarship](http://manifold.umn.edu). The development of Manifold is performed by [Cast Iron Coding](http://castironcoding.com), a digital development agency in Portland, Oregon.

#### Manifold is Open Source

Our ultimate goal is to build an open source tool that other university presses will use. To that end, we want to hear from our prospective users throughout the design and development process. To participate in the discussion, join us on our [Building Manifold Development Blog](http://manifold.umn.edu). Early adopters of Manifold are encouraged to download the source code, experiment, and submit fixes and features in the form of pull requests.
